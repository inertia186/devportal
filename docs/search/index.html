  							"url": "/introduction/launch",
  							"content": "The buzz is real! After weeks of hard teamwork, we’re announcing the launch of the new Hive blockchain.\nThis is an exciting time, and an opportunity to channel the love and power of a resilient and tenacious community into collaborative development for the future of social blockchain.\n\nHive is a passionate effort, created by a large group of Steem community members who have long looked to move towards true decentralization and to help develop the code base. The years of distribution issues and reliance on a central entity for code and infrastructure has been at the heart of a revolution of sorts, and the new Hive blockchain is the culmination of stepping up to meet the challenge of returning to shared values of protecting and celebrating the vibrant community that has grown around our ecosystem.\n\nCheck out the FAQ below for info on the launch of Hive.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Hive and why was it created?\n\nHive is a DPOS governance blockchain created by implementing a hard fork of existing Steem code.\n\nThe intention of this community-driven fork is to support and build on the strong Steem community values that have made our ecosystem so diverse and exciting. This new direction steps away from the burden of the Steemit Inc. ninja-mined stake, which has impacted the long term ability to work towards further development and decentralization for years.\n\nHive has begun with a talented and committed team of community developers who are already paving the way to implement much awaited improvements and robust new developments to the blockchain. It is exciting to see the community – from devs and business owners to passionate end users – stepping forward to embrace and contribute to the potential of Hive. This renewed spirit, combined with a renewed codebase and a focus on working more closely with the entire ecosystem, is key to the success and possibilities for the future of social blockchain.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between Hive and Steem?\nHive is a fork of the Steem blockchain and runs completely independently from the existing chain.  All valid accounts on the Steem blockchain will receive an airdrop on Hive. (more details below)\n\nWhile the Hive chain is a fork of the Steem code, the intention is to take responsibility to build something even better. The initial Hive launch will be a direct copy of existing blockchain with a few small upgrades, which will allow us to get back to community discussion on the direction for future development, needed changes, and most wanted chain-level features.\n\nThe spirit of Steem and the goal of decentralization has always been to move away from a single point of authority, and to capitalize on and encourage the potential that has gathered in our community. Hive is drawing on the huge range of talent in our ecosystem to accelerate development, improve communication, and return to a focus on ease of use, onboarding, and marketing. The desire to move towards better decentralization and to connect people via blockchain has never been lost, and it’s what makes Hive so needed now.\n\n\nWhat happens when Hive launches?\nWhen The Hive blockchain launches, existing Steem accounts will appear on the Hive Network as well. You will have two accounts: the current one on the Steem, and a new Hive account, which will be pre-populated with all of your current Steem content and information.\n\nThe history of these two accounts will be the same, but from the snapshot point onward, the accounts will be independent from one another. Actions you take on one network will not be reflected on the other. This means that future content and transactions will belong to whichever account you use.\n\nIf you post on Hive, it will not show up on Steem, and vice versa. The two chains will be completely independent of one another after launch.\n\n\nWhen will Hive launch?\nThe Hive blockchain launch will be at 10am EST/14:00 UTC, Friday, March 20th. (countdown at https://hive.io/) All of the magic will happen this week! The snapshot and airdrop will take place back to back at the time of launch. \n\n\nWhere can I find Hive’s code?\nHere is the public open source repo for Hive:\nhttps://github.com/openhive-network/hive/releases\n\nAs a STEEM  holder, what do I get in the Hive airdrop?\nAll valid STEEM stakeholders will receive a perfectly mirrored balance of their current STEEM holdings in the new HIVE coin. This will include matching amounts of current liquid STEEM, Steem Power, and SBD. All other account state data, such as claimed accounts, delegations, etc. will be mirrored onto Hive.\n\nFor example: if your Steem account has 10 STEEM, 5 SBD, and 1000 SP, your new Hive account will have 10 HIVE, 5 HBD, and 1000 HP.\n\nYou will not need to claim anything. Simply log in with your existing Steem account details and you will have your new HIVE coins in your wallet and be able to start using the blockchain.\n\nThe Hive airdrop will only be performed on the current version of the Steem blockchain (as of the date of this post). Any “emergency hardforks” performed prior to the airdrop will not be eligible. Further, any exchange that participates in such a hardfork prior to the airdrop date will null and void the ability to participate in the airdrop for its off-chain balance holding customers.\n\n\nHow do I access my Hive account to post content and send Hive coins?\nYou can access your Hive account by simply logging in on the Hive Network using your existing Steem account keys. The first frontend available will be https://hive.blog. This is currently pointed at the Steem blockchain, but will be switched to Hive at launch time. Other popular interfaces are completing the switch over to Hive or finishing new products, and will be announcing when they are ready to use!\n\n\nWho is behind the development of Hive?\nThere are currently over 30 experienced developers contributing to the new ecosystem, alongside many committed community members working on multiple aspects of Hive. These individuals may announce their participation through their own accounts in the future. This a true community effort, and therefore is open to all. Hive will remain open source, and open to everyone who wants to contribute to the future development of the blockchain. Testnet will be available after this post is published, so feel free to comment here if you would like to access and we’ll reach out. The full codebase will move to a public repo on Thursday, March 19th, prior to launch. Updates will be made to this post and via this account.\n\n\nWhat improvements have been added?\nThe most important improvements and decisions will be made after initial launch with a chance for proper feedback from the community. To successfully launch, there are some aspects that needed to be addressed immediately, including prevention of exchanges from participating in governance attacks (as we witnessed on the Steem Blockchain).\n\nTo prevent governance (or funding) attacks, a 30 day delay has been added on crediting vests towards witness and SPS votes. Further governance changes will need to be developed alongside the community.\n\nThis delay means that after an account “powers up” or stakes funds, there will be a 30 day delay before those vests can be used towards voting on governance (witnesses) or through voting in the SPS. For all other actions, there is no delay and vests are immediately available.\n\nThis is an initial way for us to mitigate this risk while continuing to improve the system as a whole, and without deciding on governance changes before returning to collection of wider community input. \n\n\nWill all Steem accounts be included in the HIVE airdrop?\nThe goal of Hive is to continue moving towards true decentralization, and therefore the launch airdrop will include all accounts who have showcased these same values and shared goals.\n\nThe only accounts who will not be included in the initial airdrop are those containing the Steemit Inc ninja-mined stake, and those who actively contributed to (and publicly declared support for) the centralization of the Steem Blockchain.\n\nThese accounts can still choose to take part in the new chain and their accounts will exist, but they will not be included in the intial airdrop.\n\n\nImportant notes for cryptocurrency exchanges that list STEEM\nDo you plan to support the Hive airdrop by taking a snapshot of your customer’s Steem holdings at the time of the airdrop and credit them with a similar amount of Hive (Yes/No)?\nYES) If you DO want to participate in the airdrop, please notify the Hive team that your exchange will distribute the airdrop on a pro-rata basis to your Steem customers (no fixed timeline for distribution is required), and the Hive account that corresponds to your Steem account will receive the airdrop at the time of the launch of Hive.\n\nNO) If you DO NOT want to participate in the airdrop, please send out a notification to your Steem-holding users to forewarn them that you will not be participating, so that they can temporarily withdraw their Steem from your exchange before the airdrop snapshot date, if they wish to participate in the Hive airdrop.\n\nIf at all possible, please let us know by Thursday, March 19 if you will or will not be participating in the airdrop.\n\nYou can notify us by leaving a message on this post using your official Steem account, or you can contact one of our exchange liaisons:\n\n  Gandalf (located in Europe)\ntelegram: @Gandalf_the_Grey\nemail: gandalf@hive.expert\n  David Jefferys (located in US)\ntelegram: @djefferys\n\n\nDirect follow-ups will be made, but if we do not receive an affirmative response by days end Thursday, March 19th, we will assume that your exchange doesn’t wish to participate in the airdrop for holding customer balances.\n\nWe’re looking forward to the launch of Hive!\nThere’s a lot to come during this extremely busy week, and this post and account will be updated to reflect new information as it becomes available.\nThank you for the spirit of community, and for being a part of the buzz. Looking forward to what’s ahead for everyone who wants to get involved… #hiveisalive!\n\nhttps://hive.io/\n\n\n\n\n  See: Announcing the Launch of Hive Blockchain\n  by\n  @hiveio"

Another excellent tool for checking real-time full node status is geo.steem.pl by @jamzed.\n\nPrivate Nodes\n\nThe simplest way to get started is by deploying a pre-built dockerized container.\n\nDockerized p2p Node\n\nTo run a p2p node (ca. 2GB of memory is required at the moment):\n\nDockerized Full Node\n\nto run a node with all the data (e.g. for supporting a content website) that uses ca. 14GB of memory and growing:\n\nSyncing blockchain\n\nNormally syncing blockchain starts from very first, 0 genesis block. It might take long time to catch up with live network. Because it connectes to various p2p nodes in the Steem network and requests blocks from 0 to head block. It stores blocks in block log file and builds up the current state in the shared memory file. But there is a way to bootstrap syncing by using trusted block_log file. The block log is an external append only log of the blocks. It contains blocks that are only added to the log after they are irreversible because the log is append only.\n\nTrusted block log file helps to download blocks faster. Steemit Inc, provides public block log file which can be downloaded from here and there is also option from community witness @gtg which can be downloaded from here.\n\nBoth block_log files updated periodically, as of May 2018 uncompressed block_log file size ~110 GB. Docker container on stable branch of Steem source code has option to use USE_PUBLIC_BLOCKLOG=1 to download latest block log and start Steem node with replay.\n\nBlock log should be place in blockchain directory below data_dir and node should be started with --replay-blockchain to ensure block log is valid and continue to sync from the point of snapshot. Replay uses the downloaded block log file to build up the shared memory file up to the highest block stored in that snapshot and then continues with sync up to the head block.\n\nReplay helps to sync blockchain in much faster rate, but as blockchain grows in size replay might also take some time to verify blocks.\n\nThere is another trick which might help with faster sync/replay on smaller equipped servers:\n\nwhile :\ndo\n   dd if=blockchain/block_log iflag=nocache count=0\n   sleep 60\ndone\n\n\nAbove bash script drops block_log from the OS cache, leaving more memory free for backing the blockchain database. It might also help while running live, but measurement would be needed to determine this.\n\nFew other tricks that might help:\n\nFor Linux users, virtual memory writes dirty pages of the shared file out to disk more often than is optimal which results in steemd being slowed down by redundant IO operations. These settings are recommended to optimize reindex time.\n\necho    75 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/dirty_background_ratio\necho  1000 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/dirty_expire_centisecs\necho    80 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio\necho 30000 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/dirty_writeback_centisecs\n\n\nAnother settings that can be changed in config.ini is flush - it is to specify a target number of blocks to process before flushing the chain database to disk. This is needed on Linux machines and a value of 100000 is recommended. It is not needed on OS X, but can be used if desired.\n\ndocker run \\\n    -d -p 2001:2001 -p 8090:8090 --name steemd-default \\\n    steemit/steem\n\ndocker logs -f steemd-default  # follow along\n\ndocker run \\\n    --env USE_WAY_TOO_MUCH_RAM=1 \\\n    -d -p 2001:2001 -p 8090:8090 --name steemd-full \\\n    steemit/steem\n\ndocker logs -f steemd-full"

  							"content": "Steem blockchain software is written in C++ and in order to modify the source code you need some understanding of the C++ programming language. Each Steem node runs an instance of this software, so in order to test your changes, you will need to know how to install dependencies which can be found in the Steem repo. This also means that some knowledge of System administration is also required. There are multiple advantages of running a testnet, you can test your scripts or applications on a testnet without extra spam on the live network, which allows much more flexibility to try new things. Having access to a testnet also helps you to work on new features and possibly submit new or improved pull requests to official the Steem GitHub repository.\n\nSteemit’s Testnet\n\nSteemit maintains a live testnet to which you can connect. In the near future, we expect the chain id to update with every code change. To get the current chain id for any HF20+ Steem testnet you can use the database_api.get_version api call (curl example included for your convenience). Be sure to point it at an api node on the testnet for which you want information!\n\nFeatures\n\nThe official Steemit, Inc. Testnet is a mirror of the mainnet.  This is achieved by copying the existing accounts and transactions from the mainnet state, as the they happen.  Accounts are copied from a snapshot of mainnet while the module used to copy transactions in real time is called gatling.  The gatling module runs at the final step of each testnet deployment.\n\nThe combination of snapshot and gatling means that this testnet approaches a subset of the same activity that the mainnet experiences.  Not everything can be mirrored.  For example, if someone comments or votes on a post that hasn’t been mirrored to the testnet (because the post itself pre-dates the testnet deploy), those operations will also not be included.\n\nAt the time of this writing, the connection information for Steemit’s testnet is as follows:\n\n\n  ChainID: d043ab83d223f25f37e1876fe48a240d49d8e4b1daa2342064990a8036a8bb5b\n  Address prefix: TST\n  API node: https://testnet.steemitdev.com\n\n\nRunning a Testnet Node\n\nFirst, let’s build steemd specifically for testnet.  Recommended specs:\n\n\n  Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS\n  100GB HDD\n  16GB RAM (mostly needed for steemd build)\n\n\nsudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nsudo reboot\n\nsudo apt-get install autoconf automake autotools-dev bsdmainutils build-essential cmake doxygen \\\n   git libboost-all-dev libreadline-dev libssl-dev libtool ncurses-dev pbzip2 pkg-config \\\n   python3-dev python3-jinja2 python3-pip libbz2-dev libsnappy-dev\\\n   wget curl screen pv virtualenv nano xz-utils\nmkdir -p src\ncd src\ngit clone https://github.com/steemit/steem\ncd steem\ngit checkout master # or a specific testnet branch\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\nmkdir -p build\ncd build\ncmake \\\n   -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \\\n   -DBUILD_STEEM_TESTNET=ON \\\n   -DLOW_MEMORY_NODE=ON \\\n   -DCHAINBASE_CHECK_LOCKING=ON \\\n   -DCLEAR_VOTES=ON \\\n   -DSKIP_BY_TX_ID=ON \\\n   -DSTEEM_LINT_LEVEL=OFF \\\n   ..\nmake -j$(nproc) install\ncd\nmkdir -p testnet-data\ncd testnet-data\nnano config.ini\n\n\nconfig.ini\n\nlog-console-appender = {\"appender\":\"stderr\",\"stream\":\"std_error\"}\nlog-file-appender = {\"appender\":\"p2p\",\"file\":\"logs/p2p/p2p.log\"}\nlog-logger = {\"name\":\"default\",\"level\":\"info\",\"appender\":\"stderr\"}\nlog-logger = {\"name\":\"p2p\",\"level\":\"warn\",\"appender\":\"p2p\"}\n\nbacktrace = yes\nplugin = chain p2p webserver witness database_api network_broadcast_api block_api \n\nshared-file-dir = \"blockchain\"\nshared-file-size = 12G\np2p-endpoint = 0.0.0.0:2001\nwebserver-http-endpoint = 0.0.0.0:8751\nwebserver-ws-endpoint = 0.0.0.0:8752\n\n# testnet.steemitdev.com\np2p-seed-node = testnet.steemitdev.com:2001\n\n\nThen execute:\n\nsteemd --data-dir=. --chain-id=d043ab83d223f25f37e1876fe48a240d49d8e4b1daa2342064990a8036a8bb5b\n\n\nNow let it sync, and you’ll have a shiny new testnet seed node to play with.\n\nCustom Testnet\n\nIn order to create a custom, isolated, testnet separate from the Steemit’s we need to modify a few things mentioned in the previous section.\n\nIn the file named steem/libraries/protocol/include/steem/protocol/config.hpp, we can see the first few lines dedicated to the Testnet section. The line starts with #ifdef IS_TEST_NET.\n\nLet’s say we want to create a custom testnet with an initial supply of 1,000,000 STEEM. We can change STEEM_INIT_SUPPLY 1,000,000 and by changing STEEM_CHAIN_ID_NAME \"testnet\", testnet to mytestnet we will automatically get a unique Chain ID for our testnet. The address prefix can be set to something like MTN and of course, we need to change the public and private keys to the genesis account. Note that the genesis account will receive the entire pre-mined supply of 1,000,000. That way, you can execute a setup script to fund any newly created accounts. Such a custom testnet will not have any additional hardware requirements to run.\n\nA minimum of 8GB RAM should be sufficient to run a custom testnet. Currently, Steem only has Linux and Mac compiling guides to build. A testnet can either be hosted locally, on a rented AWS, or dedicated bare metal servers so one can start testing functionality, explore different APIs, and start developing.\n\nOne more crucial point to modify is to change the number of witnesses required to accept hardforks for a custom testnet, by default it is set to 17, we can change it to 1 STEEM_HARDFORK_REQUIRED_WITNESSES 1 so that only one node instance would be sufficient and the network will be still functional and fast.\n\nAnother thing to note is that you can start a new chain with all previous hardforks already accepted, by changing the file named steem/blob/master/libraries/chain/database.cpp with the following function:\n\nvoid database::init_genesis( uint64_t init_supply ) inside try add this line:\n\nset_hardfork( 19, true );\n\nThis would mean that 19 hardforks have been accepted by witnesses and the new chain will start with all previous forks included.\n\nAfter these changes, all we have to do is compile the source code and get the steemd executable. And once we fire up the custom testnet we can start testing and experimenting.\n\nIf you want to port some data from Steem main network you can use Tinman, also developed by Steemit, to help with taking snapshots of the main network.\n\nCustom live testnet\n\nAn example of a custom testnet run by Steem community member @almost-digital. It doesn’t have a snapshot of the main network\n\n\n  ChainID: 79276aea5d4877d9a25892eaa01b0adf019d3e5cb12a97478df3298ccdd01673\n  Address prefix: STX\n  API node: https://testnet.steem.vc"

  							"content": "Definition\n\nImagehoster is a Steem-powered image hosting and proxying service. Any image uploaded to, or proxied through, your Imagehoster has a copy stored within it. This means that the image continues to be available even if 3rd party sites go down or change their URLs. For as long as your instance of imagehoster is running the image will be available, anytime you need it.\n\nThe purpose of this tool is to provide a way to host and proxy images used by condenser to help maintain the privacy of the authors and general users accessing the images.\n\nUsing ImageHoster will help limit access to IP addresses of the general user.  It will also strip image metadata related to the author’s geographical location.  It also helps to verify that the original author uploaded the image they intended.\n\nThe ability to upload images on steemit.com was originally added in January, 2017.  Please note that this tool does not store any image data on the blockchain.\n\nDetaied information on Imagehoster can be found in its repository\n\nThe API\n\nBelow are examples of how to process images with the API\n\n\n  Upload an image\n  Fetch an uploaded image\n  Proxy and resize an image\n  Get user avatar image\n  Signing uploads\n  How to run\n\n\n1. Upload an image \n\nPOST /&lt;username&gt;/&lt;signature&gt;\n\nThis returns a JSON object container the URL to the uploaded image, ex:\n\n{\n    \"url\": \"https://images.example.com/DQmZi174Xz96UrRVBMNRHb6A2FfU3z1HRPwPPQCgSMgdiUT/test.jpg\"\n}\n\n\nFor this to succeed it requires a signature from a Steem account in good standing.\n\n2. Fetch an uploaded image \n\nGET /&lt;image_hash&gt;/&lt;filename&gt;\n\nThis downloads a previously uploaded image.\n\n&lt;filename&gt; is optional but can be provided to help users and applications understand the content type (Content-Type header will still always reflect actual image type)\n\n3. Proxy and resize an image \n\nGET /&lt;width&gt;x&lt;hight&gt;/&lt;image_url&gt;\n\nThis downloads and serves the provided image_url. Something to note is that a copy will be taken of the image and will be served on subsequent requests, so even if the upstream is removed or changes, you will still get the original from the proxy endpoint.\n\n&lt;width&gt; and &lt;height&gt; can be set to 0 to preserve the image’s dimensions, if they are &gt;0 the image will be aspect resized (down-sample only) to fit.\n\n4. Get user avatar image \n\nGET /u/&lt;username&gt;/avatar/&lt;size&gt;\n\nThis presents the avatar for username. If no avatar is set, a default image will be served. This default is set in the service config.\n\nThe sizes are:\n\n  small - 64x64\n  medium - 128x128\n  large - 512x512\n\n\nThe avatars follow the same sizing rules as proxied images, so you not guaranteed to get a square image, just an image fitting inside of the size square\n\n5. Signing uploads \n\nUploads also require a signature made by a Steem account’s posting authority. The account has to also be above a certain (service configurable) reputation threshold.\n\nCreating a signature for node.js and with dsteem:\n\nconst dsteem = require('dsteem')\nconst crypto = require('crypto')\nconst fs = require('fs')\n\nconst [wif, file] = process.argv.slice(2)\n\nif (!wif || !file) {\n    process.stderr.write(`Usage: ./sign.js &lt;posting_wif&gt; &lt;file&gt;\\n`)\n    process.exit(1)\n}\n\nconst data = fs.readFileSync(file)\nconst key = dsteem.PrivateKey.fromString(wif)\nconst imageHash = crypto.createHash('sha256')\n    .update('ImageSigningChallenge')\n    .update(data)\n    .digest()\n\nprocess.stdout.write(key.sign(imageHash).toString() + '\\n')\n\n\n6. How to run \n\nThis imagehoster demo must be run through linux due to a dependency on the make commandline.\nYou will also require node.js and yarn to run\n\n\n  \n    git clone https://github.com/steemit/imagehoster\n  \n  \n    Run make devserver\n  \n\n\nThis will pull in all dependencies and spin up a hot-reloading development server. From there the HTTP methods can be used to alter the image loaded from the &lt;./test&gt; module.\n\n\n  Run make lint to load the autolinter.\n  Run make test to run the unit tests for the active functions.\n\n\nDefault configuration variables are in &lt;./config/defailt.toml&gt; and can be overridden by environment variables as definded in &lt;./config/custom-enfironment-variables.toml&gt;\n\nThe load order for the config files are: env vars &gt; config/$NODE_ENV.toml &gt; config/default.toml"

A reasonable set of defaults would be:\n\n\n  \n    \n      Upstream\n      API\n      Method\n      Parameters\n      TTL (seconds)\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      steemd\n      login_api\n      all\n      all\n      -1\n    \n    \n      steemd\n      network_broadcast_api\n      all\n      all\n      -1\n    \n    \n      steemd\n      follow_api\n      all\n      all\n      10\n    \n    \n      steemd\n      market_history_api\n      all\n      all\n      1\n    \n    \n      steemd\n      database_api\n      all\n      all\n      3\n    \n    \n      steemd\n      database_api\n      get_block\n      all\n      -2\n    \n    \n      steemd\n      database_api\n      get_block_header\n      all\n      -2\n    \n    \n      steemd\n      database_api\n      get_content\n      all\n      1\n    \n    \n      steemd\n      database_api\n      get_state\n      all\n      1\n    \n    \n      steemd\n      database_api\n      get_state\n      '/trending'\n      30\n    \n    \n      steemd\n      database_api\n      get_state\n      'trending'\n      30\n    \n    \n      steemd\n      database_api\n      get_state\n      '/hot'\n      30\n    \n    \n      steemd\n      database_api\n      get_state\n      '/welcome'\n      30\n    \n    \n      steemd\n      database_api\n      get_state\n      '/promoted'\n      30\n    \n    \n      steemd\n      database_api\n      get_state\n      '/created'\n      10\n    \n    \n      steemd\n      database_api\n      get_dynamic_global_properties\n      all\n      1\n    \n    \n      overseer\n      all\n      all\n      all\n      5\n    \n    \n      conveyor\n      all\n      all\n      all\n      -1\n    \n    \n      sbds\n      all\n      all\n      all\n      3\n    \n    \n      hivemind\n      all\n      all\n      all\n      3\n    \n    \n      yo\n      all\n      all\n      all\n      3\n    \n  \n\n\nIn this case, requests for login_api and network_broadcast_api have a TTL of -1, which means requests with those namespaces are not cached, whereas follow_api request have a TTL of 10 seconds.\n\nSome methods and parameters have their own TTL that overrides the general default, like database_api.get_block, which overrides database_api.*.\n\nTime to Live Special Meaning\n\n\n  0 won’t expire\n  -1 won’t be cached\n  -2 will be cached without expiration only if it is irreversible in terms of blockchain consensus\n\n\nIf you have a local copy of jussi (see: Installation), you can change these defaults by modifying DEV_config.json.\n\nMultiple Routes\n\nEach urls key can have multiple endpoints for each namespace.  For example:\n\n{\n  \"urls\":[\n    [\"appbase\", \"https://api.steemitdev.com\"]\n  ]\n}\n\n\n… can also be expressed as:\n\n{\n  \"urls\":[\n    [\"appbase\",\"https://api.steemitdev.com\"],\n    [\"appbase.condenser_api.get_account_history\",\"https://api-for-account-history.steemitdev.com\"],\n    [\"appbase.condenser_api.get_ops_in_block\",\"https://api-for-get-ops-in-block.steemitdev.com\"]\n  ]\n}\n\n\nIn these examples, the methods get_account_history and get_ops_in_block route to a dedicated API endpoint, while the rest of the appbase namespace routes to a common endpoint.\n\nRetry\n\nAdding a retries element defines the number of retry attempts, where 0 (or absent) means no retry.  The maximum number of retries is 3.\n\nNote that retrying broadcast methods is not recommended, which is why the example explicitly sets steemd.network_broadcast_api to 0.\n\njson-rpc batch\n\nNormally, a request is made with a JSON Object ({}).  But jussi also supports batch requests, which is constructed with a JSON Array of Objects ([{}]).\n\nFor example, this would be a typical, non-batched JSON Object request that asks for a single block:\n\ncurl -s --data '{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\", \"method\":\"condenser_api.get_block\", \"params\":[1], \"id\":1}' https://api.steemit.com\n\n\n{\n   \"id\":1,\n   \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\n   \"result\":{\n      \"previous\":\"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\n      \"timestamp\":\"2016-03-24T16:05:00\",\n      \"witness\":\"initminer\",\n      \"transaction_merkle_root\":\"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\n      \"extensions\":[\n\n      ],\n      \"witness_signature\":\"204f8ad56a8f5cf722a02b035a61b500aa59b9519b2c33c77a80c0a714680a5a5a7a340d909d19996613c5e4ae92146b9add8a7a663eef37d837ef881477313043\",\n      \"transactions\":[\n\n      ],\n      \"block_id\":\"0000000109833ce528d5bbfb3f6225b39ee10086\",\n      \"signing_key\":\"STM8GC13uCZbP44HzMLV6zPZGwVQ8Nt4Kji8PapsPiNq1BK153XTX\",\n      \"transaction_ids\":[\n\n      ]\n   }\n}\n\n\nTo request more than one block using the batch construct, wrap each call in a JSON Array, that asks for two blocks in one request:\n\ncurl -s --data '[{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\", \"method\":\"condenser_api.get_block\", \"params\":[1], \"id\":1},{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\", \"method\":\"condenser_api.get_block\", \"params\":[2], \"id\":2}]' https://api.steemit.com\n\n\n[\n   {\n      \"id\":1,\n      \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\n      \"result\":{\n         \"previous\":\"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\n         \"timestamp\":\"2016-03-24T16:05:00\",\n         \"witness\":\"initminer\",\n         \"transaction_merkle_root\":\"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\n         \"extensions\":[\n\n         ],\n         \"witness_signature\":\"204f8ad56a8f5cf722a02b035a61b500aa59b9519b2c33c77a80c0a714680a5a5a7a340d909d19996613c5e4ae92146b9add8a7a663eef37d837ef881477313043\",\n         \"transactions\":[\n\n         ],\n         \"block_id\":\"0000000109833ce528d5bbfb3f6225b39ee10086\",\n         \"signing_key\":\"STM8GC13uCZbP44HzMLV6zPZGwVQ8Nt4Kji8PapsPiNq1BK153XTX\",\n         \"transaction_ids\":[\n\n         ]\n      }\n   },\n   {\n      \"id\":2,\n      \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\n      \"result\":{\n         \"previous\":\"0000000109833ce528d5bbfb3f6225b39ee10086\",\n         \"timestamp\":\"2016-03-24T16:05:36\",\n         \"witness\":\"initminer\",\n         \"transaction_merkle_root\":\"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\n         \"extensions\":[\n\n         ],\n         \"witness_signature\":\"1f3e85ab301a600f391f11e859240f090a9404f8ebf0bf98df58eb17f455156e2d16e1dcfc621acb3a7acbedc86b6d2560fdd87ce5709e80fa333a2bbb92966df3\",\n         \"transactions\":[\n\n         ],\n         \"block_id\":\"00000002ed04e3c3def0238f693931ee7eebbdf1\",\n         \"signing_key\":\"STM8GC13uCZbP44HzMLV6zPZGwVQ8Nt4Kji8PapsPiNq1BK153XTX\",\n         \"transaction_ids\":[\n\n         ]\n      }\n   }\n]\n\n\nError responses are returned in the JSON Array response as well.

These funds are dedicated to the Steem Proposal System (SPS) for platform improvements.\n\nEvery day a portion of the SBD fund managed by the Steem.DAO is distributed to various proposals, depending on a) how much the proposal is asking for and b) how much approval the proposal has.\n\n\n  The Steem.DAO was a concept proposed by @blocktrades to allow Steem users to publicly propose work they are willing to do in exchange for pay. Steem users can then vote on these proposals in almost the same way they vote for witnesses.

  							"content": "What is SteemConnect?\n\nThe goal of SteemConnect is to provide a safe way of connecting to the blockchain via 3rd party apps without compromising the security of your private keys and passwords. It’s a simple identity layer built on top of the blockchain allowing users safe access and developers the freedom of not having to handle the authentication system, i.e. managing users’ private keys and encryption. This means that devs won’t have to opensource their projects in order to gain user trust. When connecting to apps in this manner, neither SteemConnect nor the authorised app store the private keys as the posting key is incrypted on your cookie.\n\nHow SteemConnect is implemented\n\nSteemConnect works by granting an access token to the requesting app once the application has been approved.\nA full tutorial on how to set up an application, request authorisation and grant access can be found here.\n\nSteem Authorisation and OAuth 2\n\nThe OAuth protocol allows third party apps to grant limited access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource owner or by allowing the app to obtain access on its own behalf. The authorisation is provided without the private key or password of the user being shared with the third party.\nSimplified, the process includes the following steps:\n\n\n  The user is presented with an authorisation link that requests a token from the API\n  The user has to log in to the service to verify their identity whereupon they will be prompted to authorise the application\n  The user is redirected to the application redirect URI along with the access token\n\n\nOnce the application has an access token, it may use the token to access the user’s account via the API, limited to the scope of access, until the token expires or is revoked.\nA full breakdown of OAuth2 and how it applies to SteemIt and SteemConnect can be found here.\n\nUseful Links\n\n\n  SteemConnect Repo\n  Community Resources\n\n\nFor additional material you can refer to the original steemit blog post by busy.org"

  							"content": "Steem blockchain software is written in C++ and in order to modify the source code you need some understanding of the C++ programming language. Each Steem node runs an instance of this software, so in order to test your changes, you will need to know how to install dependencies which can be found in the Steem repo. This also means that some knowledge of System administration is also required. There are multiple advantages of running a testnet, you can test your scripts or applications on a testnet without extra spam on the live network, which allows much more flexibility to try new things. \nHaving access to a testnet also helps you to work on new features and possibly submit new or improved pull requests to official the Steem GitHub repository.\n\nRunning Testnet\n\nBy following official build steps and enabling the BUILD_STEEM_TESTNET flag during compilation, you should be able to run the Steem Testnet locally on your workstation and join the development testnet. Docker can also be used to get started quickly. Compilation generates the steemd executable which is the main daemon for the Steem network. Additional cli_wallet can also be compiled to test/connect to an instance of steemd and request some data from the network, but it is not necessary to run a node.\n\nThe development testnet requires a certain minimum set of hardware requirements, depending on the type of compile flags that have been enabled. Because it is a mirror of the live network, private keys are the same for accounts up to the point of the snapshot timestamp of the testnet.\n\nJoining/Running the development testnet requires around 10 GB for block log on an SSD and 8 GB RAM. The CPU requirements are the same.\n\nTestnet has the following parameters by default (as of this writing):\n\n\n  Initial supply (250 billion) - STEEM_INIT_SUPPLY 250,000,000,000\n  Max number of blocks to be produced - TESTNET_BLOCK_LIMIT 3,000,000\n  Address prefix, prefix on public addresses - STEEM_ADDRESS_PREFIX \"TST\"\n  Chain id name, used for chain id - STEEM_CHAIN_ID_NAME \"testnet\"\n  Chain id, unique id hash of chain - STEEM_CHAIN_ID (fc::sha256::hash(STEEM_CHAIN_ID_NAME))\n  Public key of genesis account - STEEM_INIT_PUBLIC_KEY_STR \n  Account creation fee - STEEM_MIN_ACCOUNT_CREATION_FEE 0\n\n\nThere are a number of other subtle changes that we don’t need to focus on right now.\n\nLive testnet\n\n\n  ChainID: d043ab83d223f25f37e1876fe48a240d49d8e4b1daa2342064990a8036a8bb5b\n  Address prefix: TST\n  API node: https://testnet.steemitdev.com\n\n\nAnyone can join the Live testnet and start testing their node and applications, become a witness, and provide API (RPC) node for public use.\n\nCustom Testnet\n\nIn order to create a custom testnet, separate from the development one, we need to modify a few parameters mentioned in the previous section.\n\nIn the file named steem/libraries/protocol/include/steem/protocol/config.hpp, we can see the first few lines dedicated to the Testnet section.  The line starts with #ifdef IS_TEST_NET.\n\nLet’s say we want to create a custom testnet with an initial supply of 1,000,000 STEEM. We can change STEEM_INIT_SUPPLY 1,000,000 and by changing STEEM_CHAIN_ID_NAME \"testnet\", testnet to mytestnet we will automatically get a unique Chain ID for our testnet. The address prefix can be set to something like MTN and of course, we need to change the public and private keys to the genesis account. Note that the genesis account will receive the entire pre-mined supply of 1,000,000.  That way, you can execute a setup script to fund any newly created accounts. Such a custom testnet will not have any additional hardware requirements to run.\n\nA minimum of 8GB RAM should be sufficient to run a custom testnet. Currently, Steem only has Linux and Mac compiling guides to build. A testnet can either be hosted locally, on a rented AWS, or dedicated bare metal servers so one can start testing functionality, explore different APIs, and start developing.\n\nOne more crucial point to modify is to change the number of witnesses required to accept hardforks for a custom testnet, by default it is set to 17, we can change it to 1 STEEM_HARDFORK_REQUIRED_WITNESSES 1 so that only one node instance would be sufficient and the network will be still functional and fast.\n\nAnother thing to note is that you can start a new chain with all previous hardforks already accepted, by changing the file named steem/blob/master/libraries/chain/database.cpp with the following function:\n\nvoid database::init_genesis( uint64_t init_supply ) inside try add this line:\n\nset_hardfork( 19, true );\n\nThis would mean that 19 hardforks have been accepted by witnesses and the new chain will start with all previous forks included.\n\nAfter these changes, all we have to do is compile the source code and get the steemd executable. And once we fire up the custom testnet we can start testing and experimenting.\n\nIf you want to port some data from Steem main network you can use Tinman, also developed by Steemit, to help with taking snapshots of the main network.\n\nCustom live testnet\n\n\n  ChainID: 79276aea5d4877d9a25892eaa01b0adf019d3e5cb12a97478df3298ccdd01673\n  Address prefix: STX\n  API node: https://testnet.steem.vc\n\n\nThe above testnet is powered by community member @almost-digital and doesn’t have a snapshot of the main network."

And accounts queried are real users with reputation.\n\nIntro\n\nThis tutorial will show the method of capturing a queried tag name and matching it to the Steem. We are using the call function provided by the dsteem library to pull accounts from the Steem blockchain. A simple HTML interface is used to both capture the string query as well as display the completed search.\n\nsteps\n\n\n  App setup Configuration of dsteem to use the proper connection and network.\n  Search account Collecting the relevant search criteria\n  Interpret account reputation Running the search and interpreting reputation.\n  Output Displaying the results\n\n\n1. App setup \n\nBelow we have dsteem pointing to the production network with the proper chainId, addressPrefix, and endpoint. There is a public/app.js file which holds the Javascript segment of this tutorial. In the first few lines we define the configured library and packages:\n\nconst dsteem = require('dsteem');\nlet opts = {};\n//connect to production server\nopts.addressPrefix = 'STM';\nopts.chainId =\n    '0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000';\n//connect to server which is connected to the network/production\nconst client = new dsteem.Client('https://api.steemit.com');\n\n\n2. Search account \n\nCollecting of the search criteria happens via an HTML input. The form can be found in the index.html file. The values are pulled from that screen with the below:\n\nconst max = 5;\nwindow.submitAcc = async () =&gt; {\n    const accSearch = document.getElementById('username').value;\n\n\n3. Interpret account reputation \n\nIn order to get accounts, we run the search with the search field and maximum list items as parameters.\n\nconst _accounts = await client.database.call('lookup_accounts',[accSearch, max]);\n\n\nThe result of the search is an array of accounts. After that we use get_accounts to pull account data from Steem.\n\nconst acc = await client.database.call('get_accounts',[_accounts]);\n\n\nAnd we loop through each account to convert their reputation to human readable format with following function:\n\nfunction log10(str) {\n    const leadingDigits = parseInt(str.substring(0, 4));\n    const log = Math.log(leadingDigits) / Math.LN10 + 0.00000001;\n    const n = str.length - 1;\n    return n + (log - parseInt(log));\n}\n\nexport const repLog10 = rep2 =&gt; {\n    if (rep2 == null) return rep2;\n    let rep = String(rep2);\n    const neg = rep.charAt(0) === '-';\n    rep = neg ? rep.substring(1) : rep;\n\n    let out = log10(rep);\n    if (isNaN(out)) out = 0;\n    out = Math.max(out - 9, 0); // @ -9, $0.50 earned is approx magnitude 1\n    out = (neg ? -1 : 1) * out;\n    out = out * 9 + 25; // 9 points per magnitude. center at 25\n    // base-line 0 to darken and &lt; 0 to auto hide (grep rephide)\n    out = parseInt(out);\n    return out;\n};\n\n\n4. Output \n\nAfter each account’s reputation is interpreted we can then display them on screen with readable reputation.\n\n//disply list of account names and reputation with line breaks\nfor (var i = 0; i &lt; _accounts.length; i++) {\n    _accounts[i] = `${_accounts[i]} - ${repLog10(acc[i].reputation)}`;\n}\ndocument.getElementById('accList').innerHTML = _accounts.join('&lt;br/&gt;');\n\n\nThat’s it!\n\nTo run this tutorial\n\n\n  clone this repo\n  cd tutorials/20_account_reputation\n  npm i\n  npm i\n  npm run dev-server or npm run start\n  After a few moments, the server should be running at http://localhost:3000/"

Also some notes about usage of client.database.getDiscussions API.\n\nIntro\n\nTutorial is demonstrates the typical process of fetching account blog posts. It is quite useful if you want to embedd your blog posts on your website these tutorial will help you achieve that goal as well. This tutorial will explain and show you how to access the Steem blockchain using the dsteem library to build a basic blog list of posts filtered by a tag\n\nSteps\n\n\n  Configure connection Configuration of dsteem to use proper connection and network\n  Query format Simple query format to help use fetch data\n  Fetch data and format Fetch data and display in proper interface\n\n\n\n\n1. Configure connection\n\nIn order to connect to the live Steem network, all we have to do is provide connection url to a server that runs on the network. dsteem by default set up to use live network but it has flexibility to adjust connection to any other testnet or custom networks, more on that in future tutorials.\n\nIn first couple lines we require package and define connection server:\n\nconst { Client } = require('dsteem');\n\nconst client = new Client('https://api.steemit.com');\n\n\n2. Query format\n\n\n  You can add a tag to filter the blog posts that you receive from the server, since we are aiming to fetch blog posts of particular user, we will define username as tag.\n  You can also limit the number of results you would like to receive from the query\n\n\nvar query = {\n    tag: 'steemitblog', // This tag is used to filter the results by a specific post tag\n    limit: 5, // This limit allows us to limit the overall results returned to 5\n};\n\n\n3. Fetch data and format\n\nclient.database.getDiscussions function is used for fetching discussions or posts. The first argument to this function determines which equivalent of the appbase condenser_api.get_discussions_by_* api calls it’s going to use.

And accounts queried are real users with unclaimed balances.\n\nIntro\n\nThis tutorial will show few functions such as querying account by name and getting unclaimed rewards. We are using the call function provided by the dsteem library to pull accounts from the Steem blockchain. A simple HTML interface is used to capture the account and its unclaimed balance as well as allowing interactively claim rewards.\n\nSteps\n\n\n  App setup Setup dsteem to use the proper connection and network.\n  Search account Get account details after input has account name\n  Fill form Fill form with account reward balances\n  Claim reward Claim reward with Steemconnect or Client signing options\n\n\n1. App setup \n\nBelow we have dsteem pointing to the production network with the proper chainId, addressPrefix, and endpoint. There is a public/app.js file which holds the Javascript segment of this tutorial. In the first few lines we define the configured library and packages:\n\nconst dsteem = require('dsteem');\nlet opts = {};\n//connect to production server\nopts.addressPrefix = 'STM';\nopts.chainId =\n    '0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000';\n//connect to server which is connected to the network/production\nconst client = new dsteem.Client('https://api.steemit.com');\n\n\n2. Search account \n\nAfter account name field is filled with some name, we do automatic search for account by name when input is focused out. HTML input forms can be found in the index.html file. The values are pulled from that screen with the below:\n\n    const accSearch = document.getElementById('username').value;\n    const _accounts = await client.database.call('get_accounts', [[accSearch]]);\n    console.log(`_accounts:`, _accounts);\n\n\n3. Fill form \n\nAfter we fetched account data, we will fill form with reward balance and show current reward balance details.\n\nconst name = _accounts[0].name;\nconst reward_steem = _accounts[0].reward_steem_balance.split(' ')[0];\nconst reward_sbd = _accounts[0].reward_sbd_balance.split(' ')[0];\nconst reward_sp = _accounts[0].reward_vesting_steem.split(' ')[0];\nconst reward_vests = _accounts[0].reward_vesting_balance.split(' ')[0];\nconst unclaimed_balance = `Unclaimed balance for ${name}: ${reward_steem} STEEM, ${reward_sbd} SBD, ${reward_sp} SP = ${reward_vests} VESTS&lt;br/&gt;`;\ndocument.getElementById('accList').innerHTML = unclaimed_balance;\ndocument.getElementById('steem').value = reward_steem;\ndocument.getElementById('sbd').value = reward_sbd;\ndocument.getElementById('sp').value = reward_vests;\n\n\n4. Claim reward \n\nWe have 2 options on how to claim rewards. Steemconnect and Client signing options. We generate Steemconnect link to claim rewards, but you can also choose client signing option to claim rewards right inside tutorial.\n\nIn order to enable client signing, we will generate operation and also show Posting Private key (wif) field to sign transaction right there client side.\nBelow you can see example of operation and signing transaction, after successful operation broadcast result will be shown in user interface. It will be block number that transaction was included.\n\nwindow.submitTx = async () =&gt; {\n    const privateKey = dsteem.PrivateKey.fromString(\n        document.getElementById('wif').value\n    );\n    const op = [\n        'claim_reward_balance',\n        {\n            account: document.getElementById('username').value,\n            reward_steem: document.getElementById('steem').value + ' STEEM',\n            reward_sbd: document.getElementById('sbd').value + ' SBD',\n            reward_vests: document.getElementById('sp').value + ' VESTS',\n        },\n    ];\n    client.broadcast.sendOperations([op], privateKey).then(\n        function(result) {\n            document.getElementById('result').style.display = 'block';\n            document.getElementById(\n                'result'\n            ).innerHTML = `&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Included in block: ${\n                result.block_num\n            }&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;`;\n        },\n        function(error) {\n            console.error(error);\n        }\n    );\n};\n\n\nThat’s it!\n\nTo run this tutorial\n\n\n  clone this repo\n  cd tutorials/21_claim_rewards\n  npm i\n  npm run dev-server or npm run start\n  After a few moments, the server should be running at http://localhost:3000/"

  							"content": "Full, runnable src of Client Signing can be downloaded as part of the JS tutorials repository.\n\n\nThis tutorial gives you overview of how client side transaction signing works under the hood.\n\nPurpose is to guide you through the steps required so that you could adapt this in your own applications.\n\nWe have predefined accounts to select for you to quickly use and few transaction types to test the process.\n\nIntro\n\nClient side signing of transaction is yet another way of interacting with Steem blockchain. Compare to Steemconnect method, client signing doesn’t rely on other servers to generate and verify transaction, except when transaction is broadcasted to the network, it should be routed through one of the servers connected to that network or blockchain. It can be your own local machine running Steem blockchain or it could be any other publicly accessible servers.\n\nSteps\n\n\n  App setup Import dsteem into app.js and prepare it to communicate with a Testnet instance of Steem blockchain\n  Get globals Network globals\n  Account selection Select predefined account\n  Operation selection Select common operations\n  Generate transaction Generate transaction with selected account and operation\n  Sign and verify transaction Sign and verify signature of the transaction\n  Broadcast transaction Broadcast signed transaction to the network\n\n\n1. App setup\n\nTestnet and Production networks only differ with few settings which helps developers to switch their application from testnet to production. One of these settings is addressPrefix - string that is defined and will be in front of every public address on that chain/network. Another one is chainId - id of that network. By defining those parameters we are selecting Testnet and connecting to publicly available server with help of dsteem library. First few lines of code in public/app.js gives you example of connection to different networks, testnet and production.\n\nopts.addressPrefix = 'TST';\nopts.chainId =\n    'd043ab83d223f25f37e1876fe48a240d49d8e4b1daa2342064990a8036a8bb5b';\n//connect to server which is connected to the network/testnet\nconst client = new dsteem.Client('https://testnet.steemitdev.com', opts);\n\n\n\n  Disclaimer: In this tutorial we are using testnet powered by community member (@almost-digital) and predefined accounts reside on this network only.\n\n\n2. Get globals\n\nTo test connection as well as to get parameters of the connected network, we can use getDynamicGlobalProperties function from dsteem library. Only 2 fields are in our interesting for this tutorial, head_block_number - returns head or latest block number of the network, head_block_id - returns id of head block.\n\n\n\n3. Account selection\n\nWe have predefined list of accounts to help you with generate, sign, verify and broadcast transaction on testnet. Select list has posting private key for each account and onchange selection event we keep account name and credentials in memory. accountChange function shows example of turning plain posting private key into private key buffer format that is understandable by dsteem.\n\nprivateKey = dsteem.PrivateKey.fromString(\n    document.getElementById('account').value\n);\n\n\nAccount and its credentials should belong to specified testnet/mainnet network to sign/verify/broadcast transactions properly.\n\n4. Operation selection\n\nNumber of operations are also predefined to show you example of operation format. opChange also keeps selected operation name in memory.\n\n5. Generate transaction\n\nNext we have button which helps us to generate operation object. Depending on selected operation type we have different structure for operation object. Typically, each transaction object has following fields:\n\n\n  ref_block_num - references block number in past, in this example we have chosen head block number, but it is possible to use a block number from up to 65,536 blocks ago. This is required in TaPoS (Transaction as Proof of Stake) to avoid network forks.\n  ref_block_prefix - reference buffer of block id of ref_block_num as prefix\n  expiration - transaction expiration date in future, in our example we have set it +1 minute into future\n  operations - array of operations, this field holds main information about transaction type and its structure which is recognized by the network\n  extensions - any extensions to the transaction to change its parameters or options\n\n\nVote operation example\n\nop = {\n    ref_block_num: head_block_number,\n    ref_block_prefix: Buffer.from(head_block_id, 'hex').readUInt32LE(4),\n    expiration: new Date(Date.now() + expireTime).toISOString().slice(0, -5),\n    operations: [['vote', {\n        voter: account,\n        author: 'test',\n        permlink: 'test',\n        weight: 10000\n    }]],\n    extensions: [],\n}\n\n\nFirst item, operation type, vote and second item object with voter - account that is casting vote, author - author of post vote is being casted to, permlink - permanent link of the post, weight - vote weight 10000 being 100%, 1 being 0.01% smallest voting unit.\n\nAnd output of operation object/json is set to OpInput element.\n\n6. Sign and verify transaction\n\nEach operation needs to be signed before they can be sent to the network, transactions without signature will not be accepted by network. Because someone has to identify operation and sign it with their private keys. Sign transaction button calls for signTx function which is job is to sign selected operation and its obkect with selected account. And output result into TxOutput element.\n\nstx = client.broadcast.sign(op, privateKey)\n\nVerifying transaction process is mostly done automatically but to show every step, we have included this process to check validity of the transaction signature. Verify transaction button calls verifyTx function. Function then verify authority of the signature in signed transaction, if it was signed with correct private key and authority. If verification is successful user interfaces adds checkmark next to button otherwise adds crossmark to indicate state of the signature.\n\nconst rv = await client.database.verifyAuthority(stx)\n\n7. Broadcast transaction\n\nFinal step is to broadcast our signed transction to the selected server. Server chosen in Connect section will handle propagating transction to the network. After network accepts transaction it will return result with transaction id, block_num that this transaction is included to, trx_num transaction number, and if it is expired or not.\n\nconst res = await client.broadcast.send(stx)\n\nThat’s it!\n\nTo Run the tutorial\n\n\n  clone this repo\n  cd tutorials/03_client_signing\n  npm i\n  npm run dev-server or npm run start\n  After a few moments, the server should be running at http://localhost:3000/"

  							"content": "Full, runnable src of Convert Sbd To Steem can be downloaded as part of the JS tutorials repository.\n\n\nThis tutorial will take you through the process of checking a specific users’ balances and then broadcasting the intended SBD conversion to the blockchain. Demo account information has been provided to assist with the tutorial. This tutorial has been set up for the testnet but can be easily be changed for production.\n\nIt should be noted that the converted STEEM will not be available instantly as it takes 3.5 days for the transaction to be processed. It is also not possible to stop a conversion once initialised. During the 3.5 days for it to be converted and as the conversion price fluctuates you could actually be receiving less STEEM than what you should. Because of this, the method in this tutorial is NOT the preferred or most efficient way of converting SBD to STEEM. This tutorial just illustrates that it can be done in this manner.\n\nThere is a marketplace on Steemit that allows you to “sell” your SBD instantly. With this process you can get your STEEM immediately and at the exact price that you expect. The market place is the better way to convert your SBD. This article provides more information on using the market to exchange your SBD to STEEM\n\nSteemconnect offers an alternative to converting SBD with a “simple link” solution. Instead of running through a list of operations on your account, you can simply use a link similar to the one below substituting the three parameters for your own details. You will be prompted to enter your username and password before the transaction will be executed.\nhttps://steemconnect.com/sign/convert?owner=username&amp;requestid=1234567&amp;amount=0.000%20SBD\nThis is similar to the steemconnect links that have been covered in previous tutorials. For a list of signing operations that work in this manner you can go to https://v2.steemconnect.com/sign\nThis article has more information on using steemconnect\n\nIntro\n\nThis tutorial uses the database API to gather account information for the current SBD and STEEM balances of the specified user. This information is then used to assist the user in completing the conversion request. The values are then captured and the operation is transmitted via the broadcast API. The parameters for this convert function are:\n\n\n  owner - The account for which the conversion is being done\n  requestid - Integer identifier for tracking the conversion. This needs to be a unique number for a specified user\n  amount - The amount of SBD to withdraw\n\n\nThe only other information required is the private active key of the user.\n\nSteps\n\n\n  Configure connection Configuration of dsteem to communicate with a Steem blockchain\n  User account User account is captured and balances displayed\n  Input variables Collecting the required inputs via an HTML UI\n  Broadcast operation Broadcasting the operation to the blockchain\n\n\n1. Configure connection\n\nAs usual, we have a public/app.js file which holds the Javascript segment of the tutorial. In the first few lines we define the configured library and packages:\n\nimport { Client, PrivateKey } from 'dsteem';\nimport { Testnet as NetConfig } from '../../configuration'; //A Steem Testnet. Replace 'Testnet' with 'Mainnet' to connect to the main Steem blockchain.\n\nlet opts = { ...NetConfig.net };\n\n// //connect to a steem node, tesetnet in this case\nconst client = new Client(NetConfig.url, opts);\n\n\nAbove, we have dsteem pointing to the testnet with the proper chainId, addressPrefix, and endpoint by importing it from the configuration.js file. Due to this tutorial altering the blockchain it is preferable to not work on production.\n\n2. User account\n\nThe user account is input through the UI. Once entered, the user can select the search button to display the SBD and STEEM balances for that account. During this step, a random number is also generated for the requestid. This value can be changed to any integer value as long as it is unique for the specific account. If the requestid is duplicated an error to do with “uniqueness constraint” will be displayed in the console. For ease of use values for a demo account has already been entered in the relevant fields once the page loads.\n\nwindow.onload = async () =&gt; {\n    const account = NetConfig.accounts[0];\n    document.getElementById('username').value = account.address;\n    document.getElementById('privateKey').value = account.privActive;\n};\n\n\nWith the account search function as seen below.\n\nwindow.submitAcc = async () =&gt; {\n    const accSearch = document.getElementById('username').value;\n\n    const _account = await client.database.call('get_accounts', [[accSearch]]);\n    console.log(`_account:`, _account);\n\n    const availSBD = _account[0].sbd_balance \n    const availSTEEM = _account[0].balance\n\n    const balance = `Available balance: ${availSBD} and ${availSTEEM} &lt;br/&gt;`;\n    document.getElementById('accBalance').innerHTML = balance;\n\n    //create random number for requestid paramter\n    var x = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10000000);\n    document.getElementById(\"requestID\").value = x\n}\n\n\n3.

  							"content": "Full, runnable src of Create Account can be downloaded as part of the JS tutorials repository.\n\n\nThis tutorial will show how to search for a valid account name and then create a new account by means of Resource Credits or STEEM. This tutorial runs on the main Steem blockchain so extra care needs to be taken as any operation will affect real accounts.\n\nIntro\n\nThis tutorial will show few functions such as querying account by name and check if username is taken or available to register. We are using the call function provided by the dsteem library to pull account from the Steem blockchain. We then create proper private keys for new account. A simple HTML interface is used to enter payment of account creation fee and create account right inside tutorial. We use the account_create function to commit the transaction to the blockchain. This function is used to create what is called a “non-discounted account”. This means that the creator account needs to supply the exact account_creation_fee in STEEM in order for the transaction to process successfully. Currently this value is set to 3 STEEM. There is a second method of creating accounts using tokens. These are called “discounted accounts”. In stead of STEEM, the account_creation_fee is paid in RC (resource credits). There are however a limited amount of discounted accounts that can be claimed which is decided upon by the witnesses. This account creation process is done in two steps, first claiming an account and then creating the account.\n\nSteps\n\n\n  App setup Setup dsteem to use the proper connection and network.\n  Search account Get account details after input has account name\n  Generate private keys Generate proper keys for new account\n  Create account Create account via Client-side or Steemconnect\n\n\n1. App setup \n\nBelow we have dsteem pointing to the production network with the proper chainId, addressPrefix, and endpoint. There is a public/app.js file which holds the Javascript segment of this tutorial. In the first few lines we define the configured library and packages:\n\nconst dsteem = require('dsteem');\nlet opts = {};\n//connect to production server\nopts.addressPrefix = 'STM';\nopts.chainId =\n    '0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000';\n//connect to server which is connected to the network/production\nconst client = new dsteem.Client('https://api.steemit.com');\n\n\n2. Search account \n\nAfter account name field is filled with some name, tutorial has Search button to search for account by name. HTML input forms can be found in the index.html file. The values are pulled from that screen with the below:\n\nconst accSearch = document.getElementById('username').value;\nlet avail = 'Account is NOT available to register';\nif (accSearch.length &gt; 2) {\n    const _account = await client.database.call('get_accounts', [\n        [accSearch],\n    ]);\n    console.log(`_account:`, _account, accSearch.length);\n\n    if (_account.length == 0) {\n        avail = 'Account is available to register';\n    }\n}\ndocument.getElementById('accInfo').innerHTML = avail;\n\n\nWe will then do simple check if account is taken or not.\n\n3. Generate private keys \n\nAfter we know that account is available to register, we will fill form with password we wish for that account and enter creation fee. Note, that creation fees are “burned” once the new account is created. The creator account wishes to provide the new account with VEST (as per previous account creation process) they can do so by following the delegate_vesting_shares process (refer tutorial #27). Irrespective of which account creation method is being followed, the process for generating new accounts keys is the same for both.\n\nconst username = document.getElementById('username').value;\nconst password = document.getElementById('password').value;\n\nconst ownerKey = dsteem.PrivateKey.fromLogin(username, password, 'owner');\nconst activeKey = dsteem.PrivateKey.fromLogin(username, password, 'active');\nconst postingKey = dsteem.PrivateKey.fromLogin(username, password, 'posting');\nconst memoKey = dsteem.PrivateKey.fromLogin(\n    username,\n    password,\n    'memo'\n).createPublic(opts.addressPrefix);\n\nconst ownerAuth = {\n    weight_threshold: 1,\n    account_auths: [],\n    key_auths: [[ownerKey.createPublic(opts.addressPrefix), 1]],\n};\nconst activeAuth = {\n    weight_threshold: 1,\n    account_auths: [],\n    key_auths: [[activeKey.createPublic(opts.addressPrefix), 1]],\n};\nconst postingAuth = {\n    weight_threshold: 1,\n    account_auths: [],\n    key_auths: [[postingKey.createPublic(opts.addressPrefix), 1]],\n};\n\n\nAbove script shows, how to properly setup private keys of new account.\n\n4. Create account \n\nAfter following all steps properly, we can now submit transaction to create new account.\n\n//non-discounted account creation\nconst privateKey = dsteem.PrivateKey.fromString(\n    document.getElementById('wif').value\n);\nconst op = [\n    'account_create',\n    {\n        fee: document.getElementById('steem').value,\n        creator: document.getElementById('account').value,\n        new_account_name: username,\n        owner: ownerAuth,\n        active: activeAuth,\n        posting: postingAuth,\n        memo_key: memoKey,\n        json_metadata: '',\n    },\n];\n\nclient.broadcast.sendOperations([op], privateKey).then(\n    function(result) {\n        document.getElementById('result').style.display = 'block';\n        document.getElementById(\n            'result'\n        ).innerHTML = `&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Included in block: ${\n            result.block_num\n        }&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;`;\n    },\n    function(error) {\n        console.error(error);\n    }\n);\n\n\nDiscounted account creation uses the same eventual account_create parameters but does not include the optional fee parameter. We also check to see if the creator account has an account_creation_token available already and then skips the first section of claiming this token.\n\n//discounted account creation\n//private active key of creator account\nconst privateKey = dsteem.PrivateKey.fromString(document.getElementById('wif').value);\n\nlet ops = [];\n\n//claim discounted account operation\nconst creator = document.getElementById('account').value\nconst _account = await client.database.call('get_accounts', [\n    [creator],\n]);\nconsole.log('current pending claimed accounts: ' + _account[0].pending_claimed_accounts)\nif (_account[0].pending_claimed_accounts == 0) {\n    const claim_op = [\n        'claim_account',\n        {\n            creator: creator,\n            fee: '0.000 STEEM',\n            extensions: [],\n        }\n    ];\n    console.log('You have claimed a token')\n    ops.push(claim_op)\n}\n\n//create operation to transmit\nconst create_op = [\n    'create_claimed_account',\n    {\n        creator: document.getElementById('account').value,\n        new_account_name: username,\n        owner: ownerAuth,\n        active: activeAuth,\n        posting: postingAuth,\n        memo_key: memoKey,\n        json_metadata: '',\n        extensions: []\n    },\n];\nops.push(create_op)\n\n//broadcast operation to blockchain\nclient.broadcast.sendOperations(ops, privateKey).then(\n    function(result) {\n        document.getElementById('result').style.display = 'block';\n        document.getElementById(\n            'result'\n        ).innerHTML = `&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Included in block: ${\n            result.block_num\n        }&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;`;\n    },\n    function(error) {\n        console.error(error);\n    }\n);\n\n\nThat’s it!\n\nTo run this tutorial\n\n\n  clone this repo\n  cd tutorials/26_create_account\n  npm i\n  npm run dev-server or npm run start\n  After a few moments, the server should be running at http://localhost:3000/"

And accounts queried/searched are real accounts with their available VESTS balances and estimated STEEM POWER holdings.\n\nIntro\n\nThis tutorial will show few functions such as querying account by name and getting account vesting balance. We then convert VESTS to STEEM POWER for convenience of user. And allow user to choose portion or all holdings of VESTS to delegate other users. A simple HTML interface is provided to capture the account with search and its VESTS balance as well as allowing interactively delegate. It should be noted that when a delegation is cancelled, the VESTS will only be available again after a 5 day cool-down period.\n\nSteps\n\n\n  App setup Setup dsteem to use the proper connection and network.\n  Search account Get account details after input has account name\n  Calculate and Fill form Calculate available vesting shares and Fill form with details\n  Delegate power Delegate VESTS with Steemconnect or Client-side signing.\n\n\n1.

Search account \n\nAfter account name field is filled with some name, we do automatic search for account by name when input is focused out. HTML input forms can be found in the index.html file.

Calculate and Fill form \n\nAfter we fetched account data, we will fill form with VESTS balance and show current balance details. Note, that in order to get available VESTS balance we will have to check if account is already powering down and how much is powering down, how much of VESTS were delegated out which locks them from being powered down. Available balance will be in avail variable, next for convenience of user, we convert available VESTS to STEEM with getDynamicGlobalProperties function and fill form fields accordingly.\n\n    const name = _account[0].name;\n    const avail = parseFloat(_account[0].vesting_shares) - (parseFloat(_account[0].to_withdraw) - parseFloat(_account[0].withdrawn)) / 1e6 - parseFloat(_account[0].delegated_vesting_shares);\n\n    const props = await client.database.getDynamicGlobalProperties();\n    const vestSteem = parseFloat(parseFloat(props.total_vesting_fund_steem) *\n        (parseFloat(avail) / parseFloat(props.total_vesting_shares)),6);\n\n    const balance = `Available Vests for ${name}: ${avail} VESTS ~ ${vestSteem} STEEM POWER&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;`;\n    document.getElementById('accBalance').innerHTML = balance;\n    document.getElementById('steem').value = avail+' VESTS';\n\n\nOnce form is filled with maximum available VESTS balance, you can choose portion or lesser amount of VESTS to delegate other user.\n\n4. Delegate power \n\nWe have 2 options on how to delegate others. Steemconnect and Client-side signing options. By default we generate Steemconnect link to delegate power (delegate vesting shares), but you can choose client signing option to delegate right inside tutorial, note client-side signing will require Active Private key to perform the operation.\n\nIn order to enable client signing, we will generate operation and also show Active Private key (wif) field to sign transaction client side.\nBelow you can see example of operation and signing transaction, after successful operation broadcast result will be shown in user interface. It will be block number that transaction was included.\n\nwindow.submitTx = async () =&gt; {\n    const privateKey = dsteem.PrivateKey.fromString(\n        document.getElementById('wif').value\n    );\n    const op = [\n        'delegate_vesting_shares',\n        {\n            delegator: document.getElementById('username').value,\n            delegatee: document.getElementById('account').value,\n            vesting_shares: document.getElementById('steem').value,\n        },\n    ];\n    client.broadcast.sendOperations([op], privateKey).then(\n        function(result) {\n            document.getElementById('result').style.display = 'block';\n            document.getElementById(\n                'result'\n            ).innerHTML = `&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Included in block: ${\n                result.block_num\n            }&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;`;\n        },\n        function(error) {\n            console.error(error);\n        }\n    );\n};\n\n\nThat’s it!\n\nTo run this tutorial\n\n\n  clone this repo\n  cd tutorials/25_delegate_power\n  npm i\n  npm run dev-server or npm run start\n  After a few moments, the server should be running at http://localhost:3000/"

  							"content": "Full, runnable src of Edit Content Patching can be downloaded as part of the JS tutorials repository.\n\n\nThis tutorial will take you through the process of preparing and patching post using the broadcast.comment operation. Being able to patch a post is critical to save resources on Steem.\n\nIntro\n\nTutorial is demonstrating the typical process of editing content that has been previously posted on the blockchain. Instead of replacing the entire body of the post, the Steem blockchain offers an alternative strategy. In this tutorial, we will focus on properly patching existing content and then broadcasting the patch with a demo account on a testnet.\n\nNote for long time community members: Since HF20 even archived content (older than 7 days) can be changed/updated. Editing content will also use less RC (resource credits) than creating new posts entirely.\n\nWe are using the broadcast.comment function provided by dsteem which generates, signs, and broadcast the transaction to the network. On the Steem platform, posts and comments are all internally stored as a comment object, differentiated by whether or not a parent_author exists. When there is no parent_author, it’s a post, when there is, it’s a comment. When editing a post, we need to make sure that we don’t resubmit the same post over and over again, which will spam the network and adds additional cost to operate the platform. Instead we will use a package called diff-match-patch, which allows us to only apply changes and save resources on the Steem platform.\n\nSteps\n\n\n  Configure testnet Testnet connection should be established with proper configurations\n  Get latest post Get @demo’s latest post for editing\n  Creating patch Creating patch with new edited text\n  Submit a patch Submit newly formatted post\n\n\n1. Configure testnet\n\nAs usual, we have a file called public/app.js, which holds the Javascript segment of the tutorial. In the first few lines, we have defined the configured library and packages:\n\nconst dsteem = require('dsteem');\nlet opts = {};\n//connect to community testnet\nopts.addressPrefix = 'STX';\nopts.chainId =\n    '79276aea5d4877d9a25892eaa01b0adf019d3e5cb12a97478df3298ccdd01673';\n//connect to server which is connected to the network/testnet\nconst client = new dsteem.Client('https://testnet.steem.vc', opts);\n\n\nAbove, we have dsteem pointing to the test network with the proper chainId, addressPrefix, and endpoint. Because this tutorial is interactive, we will not publish test content to the main network. Instead, we’re using testnet and a predefined account to demonstrate post patching.\n\n2. Get latest post\n\nNext, we have a main function which fires at on-load and fetches latest blog post of @demo account and fills in the form with relevant information.\n\nconst query = { tag: 'demo', limit: '1' };\nclient.database\n    .call('get_discussions_by_blog', [query])\n    .then(result =&gt; {\n        document.getElementById('title').value = result[0].title;\n        document.getElementById('body').value = result[0].body;\n        document.getElementById('tags').value = JSON.parse(\n            result[0].json_metadata\n        ).tags.join(' ');\n        o_body = result[0].body;\n        o_permlink = result[0].permlink;\n    })\n    .catch(err =&gt; {\n        console.log(err);\n        alert('Error occured, please reload the page');\n    });\n\n\nNotice, we are only fetching a single blog post by specifying a limit and we have filled all necessary fields/variables with the old content.\n\n3. Creating patch\n\nWe have created a small function called createPatch to patch edits to the old content.\n\nfunction createPatch(text, out) {\n    if (!text &amp;&amp; text === '') return undefined;\n    //get list of patches to turn text to out\n    const patch_make = dmp.patch_make(text, out);\n    //turns patch to text\n    const patch = dmp.patch_toText(patch_make);\n    return patch;\n}\n\n\nThe createPatch function computes a list of patches to turn old content to edited content.\n\n4. Submit a patch\n\nNext, we have the submitPost function, which executes when the Submit button is clicked.\n\n//get private key\nconst privateKey = dsteem.PrivateKey.fromString(\n    document.getElementById('postingKey').value\n);\n//get account name\nconst account = document.getElementById('username').value;\n//get title\nconst title = document.getElementById('title').value;\n//get body\nconst edited_body = document.getElementById('body').value;\n\nlet body = '';\n\n//computes a list of patches to turn o_body to edited_body\nconst patch = createPatch(o_body, edited_body);\n\n//check if patch size is smaller than original content\nif (patch &amp;&amp; patch.length &lt; new Buffer(o_body, 'utf-8').length) {\n    body = patch;\n} else {\n    body = o_body;\n}\n\n//get tags and convert to array list\nconst tags = document.getElementById('tags').value;\nconst taglist = tags.split(' ');\n//make simple json metadata including only tags\nconst json_metadata = JSON.stringify({ tags: taglist });\n//generate random permanent link for post\nconst permlink = o_permlink;\n\nclient.broadcast\n    .comment(\n        {\n            author: account,\n            body: body,\n            json_metadata: json_metadata,\n            parent_author: '',\n            parent_permlink: taglist[0],\n            permlink: permlink,\n            title: title,\n        },\n        privateKey\n    )\n    .then(\n        function(result) {\n            document.getElementById('title').value = '';\n            document.getElementById('body').value = '';\n            document.getElementById('tags').value = '';\n            document.getElementById('postLink').style.display = 'block';\n            document.getElementById(\n                'postLink'\n            ).innerHTML = `&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Included in block: ${\n                result.block_num\n            }&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://condenser.steem.vc/${\n                taglist[0]\n            }/@${account}/${permlink}\"&gt;Check post here&lt;/a&gt;`;\n        },\n        function(error) {\n            console.error(error);\n        }\n    );\n\n\nAs you can see from the above function, we get the relevant values from the defined fields. Tags are separated by spaces in this example, but the structure of how to enter tags totally depends on your needs. We have separated tags with whitespaces and stored them in an array list called taglist, for later use. Posts on the blockchain can hold additional information in the json_metadata field, such as the tags list which we have assigned. Posts must also have a unique permanent link scoped to each account. In this case we are just creating a random character string.\n\nIn the follow code, we patch the old content with new (or edited) content and make sure that the patch size is smaller than edited content, otherwise patching is unnecessary.\n\n//computes a list of patches to turn o_body to edited_body\nconst patch = createPatch(o_body, edited_body);\n\n//check if patch size is smaller than edited content itself\nif (patch &amp;&amp; patch.length &lt; new Buffer(edited_body, 'utf-8').length) {\n    body = patch;\n} else {\n    body = edited_body;\n}\n\n\nThe next step is to pass all of these parameters to the client.broadcast.comment function. Note that in parameters you can see the parent_author and parent_permlink fields, which are used for replies (also known as comments). In our example, since we are publishing a post instead of a comment/reply, we will have to leave parent_author as an empty string and assign parent_permlink from the first tag.\n\nAfter the post has been broadcasted to the network, we can simply set all the fields to empty strings and show the post link to check it from a condenser instance running on the selected testnet. That’s it!\n\nTo Run the tutorial\n\n\n  clone this repo\n  cd tutorials/12_edit_content_patching\n  npm i\n  npm run dev-server or npm run start\n  After a few moments, the server should be running at http://localhost:3000/"

This is done with the call operation as well as the broadcast.json operation.\n\nIntro\n\nWe are using the broadcast.json operation provided by the dsteem library to follow or unfollow a selected author. There are 4 variables required to execute this operation:\n\n\n  follower - The specific user that will select the author to follow/unfollow (username).\n  privatekey - This is the private posting key of the user(postingKey).\n  following - The account/author that the user would like to follow (author).\n  what - The type of follow operation. This variable can have one of two values: blog, to follow an author, and a null value, unfollow the selected author.\n\n\nA simple HTML UI is used to capture the required information, after which the broadcast operation can be compiled.\n\nSteps\n\n\n  Configure connection Configuration of dsteem to communicate with the Steem blockchain\n  Input variables Collecting the required inputs via an HTML UI\n  Get status Get the follow status for the specified author\n  Follow operation Execute the follow operation\n\n\n1. Configure connection\n\nAs usual, we have a public/app.js file which holds the Javascript segment of the tutorial. In the first few lines we define the configured library and packages:\n\nimport { Client, PrivateKey } from 'dsteem';\nimport { Testnet as NetConfig } from '../../configuration'; //A Steem Testnet. Replace 'Testnet' with 'Mainnet' to connect to the main Steem blockchain.\n\nlet opts = { ...NetConfig.net };\n\n//connect to a steem node, testnet in this case\nconst client = new Client(NetConfig.url, opts);\n\n\nAbove, we have dsteem pointing to the test network with the proper chainId, addressPrefix, and endpoint by importing from the configuration.js file. Because this tutorial is interactive, we will not publish test content to the main network. Instead, we’re using the testnet and a predefined account which is imported once the application loads, to demonstrate following of an author.\n\nwindow.onload = async () =&gt; {\n    const account = NetConfig.accounts[0];\n    const accountI = NetConfig.accounts[1];\n    document.getElementById('username').value = account.address;\n    document.getElementById('postingKey').value = account.privPosting;\n    document.getElementById('author').value = accountI.address;\n};\n\n\n2. Input variables\n\nThe required parameters for the follow operation is recorded via an HTML UI that can be found in the public/index.html file.\n\nThe parameter values are allocated as seen below once the user clicks on the “Follow / Unfollow” button.\n\nwindow.submitFollow = async () =&gt; {\n    //get private key\n    const privateKey = dsteem.PrivateKey.fromString(\n        document.getElementById('postingKey').value\n    );\n    //get account name\n    const follower = document.getElementById('username').value;\n    //get author permalink\n    const following = document.getElementById('author').value;\n\n\n3. Get status\n\nThe current follow status for the author is called from the database and a variable is assigned in order to specify whether the follow operation should execute as follow or unfollow. For more information on this process you can refer to tutorial 19_get_follower_and_following_list.\n\nconsole.log({ follower: follower, following: following });\n\n    let status = await client.call('follow_api', 'get_following', [\n        follower,\n        following,\n        'blog',\n        1,\n    ]);\n\n    console.log({ status: status });\n\n    if (status.length &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; status[0].following == following) {\n        type = '';\n    } else {\n        type = 'blog';\n    }\n\n\n4. Follow operation\n\nA JSON with the collected input variables is created in order for the data object within the broadcast operation to be completed.\n\nconst json = JSON.stringify([\n    'follow',\n    {\n        follower: follower,\n        following: following,\n        what: [type], //null value for unfollow, 'blog' for follow\n    },\n]);\n\n\nThe broadcast.json operation requires a data object and private key in order the execute. For the follow/unfollow operation the variables in the object have predefined values. These values can change depending on the type of operation.\n\nconst data = {\n    id: 'follow',\n    json: json,\n    required_auths: [],\n    required_posting_auths: [follower],\n};\n\n\nThe broadcast operation is then executed with the created object and the private posting key. We also display the follow status on the UI in order for the user to know the whether the process was a success.\n\nclient.broadcast.json(data, privateKey).then(\n    function(result) {\n        console.log('user follow result: ', result);\n        document.getElementById('followResultContainer').style.display = 'flex';\n        document.getElementById('followResult').className =\n            'form-control-plaintext alert alert-success';\n        if (type == 'blog') {\n            document.getElementById('followResult').innerHTML =\n                'Author followed';\n        } else {\n            document.getElementById('followResult').innerHTML =\n                'Author unfollowed';\n        }\n    },\n    function(error) {\n        console.error(error);\n        document.getElementById('followResultContainer').style.display = 'flex';\n        document.getElementById('followResult').className =\n            'form-control-plaintext alert alert-danger';\n        document.getElementById('followResult').innerHTML = error.jse_shortmsg;\n    }\n);\n\n\nIf either of the values for the user or author does not exist the proper error result will be displayed on the UI. The result is also displayed in the console in order for the user to confirm that a block transaction has taken place. The status of the operation can be verified on the demo account.\n\nTo run this tutorial\n\n\n  clone this repo\n  cd tutorials/18_follow_user\n  npm i\n  npm run dev-server or npm run start\n  After a few moments, the server should be running at http://localhost:3000/"

We will also demonstrate the most commonly used fields from the response object as well as how to parse the body of each comment.\n\nIntro\n\nWe are using the get_state function with dsteem that returns the current state of the network as well as additional content. Each content body is written in markdown and could be submitted to the blockchain by many different applications built on top of Steem. For that reason we are using the remarkable npm package to parse markdown in a readable format.\n\nSteps\n\n\n  App setup Configuration of dsteem to use the proper connection and network.\n  Query Query the path which we want to extract from Steem blockchain state.\n  Formatting Formatting the JSON object to be viewed in a simple user interface.\n\n\n1. App setup\n\nBelow we have dsteem pointing to the main network with the proper chainId, addressPrefix and connection server.\nThere is a public/app.js file which holds the Javascript segment of this tutorial. In the first few lines we define and configure library and packages.\n\nconst dsteem = require('dsteem');\nlet opts = {};\n//connect to production server\nopts.addressPrefix = 'STM';\nopts.chainId =\n    '0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000';\n//connect to server which is connected to the network/production\nconst client = new dsteem.Client('https://api.steemit.com');\n\nconst Remarkable = require('remarkable');\nconst md = new Remarkable({ html: true, linkify: true });\n\n\nremarkable is assigned to the variable md with linkify and html options, allowing us to parse markdown links and html properly.\n\n2. Query\n\nNext, we have the main function which runs when the page is loaded.\n\n// query string, fetching comments made by @steemitblog account\nconst query = '/@steemitblog/comments';\n\nclient.database.call('get_state', [query]).then(result =&gt; {\n    // work with state object\n});\n\n\nquery is the path from where want to extract Steem blockchain state. In our example we are querying comments from the @steemitblog account. The result will be the current state object with various information as well as the content property holding the content of the query.\n\nThe following is an example of the returned object:\n\n{\n

We then iterate through each object in content and extract:\n\n\n  parent_author\n  parent_permlink\n  and the post or comment the @steemitblog account is replying to\n\n\nWe format created date and time, parse body markdown and get net_votes on that comment.\nEach line is then pushed and displayed separately.\n\nTo Run the tutorial\n\n\n  clone this repo\n  cd tutorials/09_get_account_comments\n  npm i\n  npm run dev-server or npm run start\n  After a few moments, the server should be running at http://localhost:3000/"

  							"url": "/tutorials-javascript/get_account_replies",
  							"content": "Full, runnable src of Get Account Replies can be downloaded as part of the JS tutorials repository.\n\n\nThe purpose of this tutorial is How to get account replies and a) demonstrate how to use get_state api function call, and b) fetch recent replies for the content of specific account, in this case @steemitblog.\n\nWe focus on listing part of the content with simply UI as well as explain the most commonly used fields from the response object as well as parse body of each comment.\n\nIntro\n\nWe are using get_state function with dsteem, which is straight-forward and this function returns current state of the network as well as additional content given proper query. Each content body, as we described in previous tutorials, is written markdown and submitted to the blockchain by many applications built on top of Steem. For that reason we are using remarkable npm package to parse markdown in a readable format.\n\nSteps\n\n\n  App setup Setup app packages\n  Query result Form a proper query and retrieve result\n  Display replies Parse and display result in user interface\n\n\n1. App setup\n\nAs usual, we have public/app.js file which holds the javascript part of the tutorial. In first few lines we define, configure library and packages.\n\nconst dsteem = require('dsteem');\nlet opts = {};\n//connect to production server\nopts.addressPrefix = 'STM';\nopts.chainId =\n    '0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000';\n//connect to server which is connected to the network/production\nconst client = new dsteem.Client('https://api.steemit.com');\n\nconst Remarkable = require('remarkable');\nconst md = new Remarkable({ html: true, linkify: true });\n\n\ndsteem is pointing to the main network and proper chain_id, addressPrefix and connection server.\nremarkable is assigned to md variable with linkify and html options, allowing markdown parsing links and html properly.\n\n2. Query result\n\nNext, we have main function which fires when page is loaded.\n\n// query string, fetching recent replies for @steemitblog account\nconst query = '/@steemitblog/recent-replies';\n\nclient.database.call('get_state', [query]).then(result =&gt; {\n    // work with state object\n});\n\n\nQuery is the path which we want to extract from Steem blockchain state. In our example we are using @steemitblog account and recent-replies to its content. Result will be current state object with various information as well as content object property holding content of the query.\n\nFollowing is example of returned object:\n\n{\n

The account information provided has been chosen by random and the process is applicable to any user account on both the production server and the testnet.\n\nIntro\n\nThis tutorial has two separate functions, one for viewing active delegations and one for viewing expiring delegations. Both of these use the database API to pull information from the steem blockchain. It should be noted that when a delegation is cancelled it will only be available after 7 days. The value of the delegation can also be changed at any time, either decreased or increased. The first function we use is getVestingDelegations for which we require the following parameters:\n\n\n  account - The username for which the query is done\n  from - The value from where to start the search. This can be used for paging. This parameter is optional\n  limit - The quantity of results that is queried from the blockchain. This parameter is optional\n\n\nThe second function is getExpiringVestingDelegations with parameters:\n\n\n  user - The account that the query is referencing\n  from time - The date from where the query will be run. Pending expirations clear after 7 days so it will never be older than that. This value can however be set to anytime before the 7 days of expiration and it will return the relevant transactions\n  limit - The quantity of results that is queried from the blockchain\n\n\nSteps\n\n\n  Configure connection Configuration of dsteem to communicate with a Steem blockchain\n  Input variables Collecting the required inputs via an HTML UI\n  Database query Sending a query to the blockchain for the user delegations\n  Display results Display the results of the blockchain query\n\n\n1. Configure connection\n\nAs usual, we have a public/app.js file which holds the Javascript segment of the tutorial. In the first few lines we define the configured library and packages:\n\nconst dsteem = require('dsteem');\nlet opts = {};\n//define network parameters\nopts.addressPrefix = 'STM';\nopts.chainId =\n    '0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000';\n//connect to a steem node, production in this case\nconst client = new dsteem.Client('https://api.steemit.com');\n\n\nAbove, we have dsteem pointing to the production network with the proper chainId, addressPrefix, and endpoint.\n\n2. Input variables\n\nThe required parameters for the delegation query operation is recorded via an HTML UI that can be found in the public/index.html file. The values are pre-populated in this case but any account name can be used.\n\nBoth of the query functions use the same input variables. The previous results are cleared each time at the start of the function. The parameter values are allocated as seen below, once the user clicks on either the “Display active delegations” or “Display expiring delegations” button.\n\n//active delegations function\nwindow.createList = async () =&gt; {\n    //clear list\n    document.getElementById('delegationList').innerHTML = '';\n\n    //get username\n    const delegator = document.getElementById('username').value;\n\n\n3.

There are 4 variables required to execute this operation:\n\n\n  username - The specific user for which the follower(ing) list will be retrieved.\n  startFollower(ing) - The starting letter(s) or name for the search query.\n  followType - This value is set to blog and includes all users following or being followed by the user.\n  limit - The maximum number of lines to be returned by the query.\n\n\nA simple HTML interface is used to capture the required information after which the function is executed.\n\nSteps\n\n\n  Configure connection Configuration of dsteem to communicate with the Steem blockchain\n  Input variables Collecting the required inputs via an HTML UI\n  Get followers/following Get the followers or users being followed\n  Display Display the array of results on the UI\n\n\n1. Configure connection\n\nAs usual, we have a public/app.js file which holds the Javascript segment of the tutorial. In the first few lines we define the configured library and packages:\n\nconst dsteem = require('dsteem');\nlet opts = {};\n//define network parameters\nopts.addressPrefix = 'STM';\nopts.chainId =\n    '0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000';\n//connect to a steem node, production in this case\nconst client = new dsteem.Client('https://api.steemit.com');\n\n\nAbove, we have dsteem pointing to the production network with the proper chainId, addressPrefix, and endpoint.\n\n2. Input variables\n\nThe required parameters for the follow operation is recorded via an HTML UI that can be found in the public/index.html file. The values have been pre-populated for ease of use but are editable.\n\nThe parameter values are allocated as seen below once the user clicks on the “Get Followers” or “Get Following” button.\nThe two queries are very similar and run from two different functions activated from a button on the UI. The first line of both functions is used to clear the display before new information is queried.\n\n//Followers function\nwindow.submitFollower = async () =&gt; {\n    //clear list\n    document.getElementById('followList').innerHTML = '';\n\n    //get user name\n    const username = document.getElementById('username').value;\n    //get starting letters / word\n    const startFollow = document.getElementById('startFollow').value;\n    //get limit\n    var limit = document.getElementById('limit').value;\n\n\n3. Get followers/following\n\nA list of followers or users being followed is called from the database with the follow_api available in the SteemJS library.\n\n//get list of followers\n//getFollowers(following, startFollower, followType, limit)\n    let followlist = await client.call('follow_api', 'get_followers', [\n        username,\n        startFollow,\n        'blog',\n        limit,\n    ]);\n\n    document.getElementById('followResultContainer').style.display = 'flex';\n    document.getElementById('followResult').className = 'form-control-plaintext alert alert-success';\n    document.getElementById('followResult').innerHTML = 'Followers';\n\n\n//get list of authors you are following\n//getFollowing(follower, startFollowing, followType, limit)\n    let followlist = await client.call('follow_api', 'get_following', [\n        username,\n        startFollow,\n        'blog',\n        limit,\n    ]);\n\n    document.getElementById('followResultContainer').style.display = 'flex';\n    document.getElementById('followResult').className = 'form-control-plaintext alert alert-success';\n    document.getElementById('followResult').innerHTML = 'Following';\n\n\n\n4. Display\n\nThe result returned from the query is an array of objects. The follower(ing) value from that array is displayed on both the UI and the console via a simple forEach array method.\n\nfollowlist.forEach(newObj =&gt; {\n    name = newObj.follower;\n    document.getElementById('followList').innerHTML += name + '&lt;br&gt;';\n    console.log(name);\n});\n\n\nTo run this tutorial\n\n\n  clone this repo\n  cd tutorials/19_get_follower_and_following_list\n  npm i\n  npm run dev-server or npm run start\n  After a few moments, the server should be running at http://localhost:3000/"

Steem offers out of box API for pulling replies for particular post with get_content_replies. We will fetch replies and list them in simple user interface.\n\nSteps\n\n\n  Fetching posts Getting trending posts\n  Post comments Open post and fetch comments\n  Query result Result of the query\n\n\n1. Fetching post\n\nAs mentioned in our previous tutorials we can fetch various lists of posts with different filters. Here, we are reusing some parts of that tutorial to list the top 5 trending posts. And we parse content of selected post to display few fields in a meaningful way.\n\n2. Post comments\n\nOn selection of a particular post from the list, openPost function is fired as it is explained in Get Post Details tutorial. This function will call the get_content function to fetch content of the post. Right after root post is displayed properly, we use get_content_replies function to fetch comments made on that post, function requires author and permlink of the root post to fetch its comments.\n\nclient.database.call('get_content_replies', [author, permlink]).then(result =&gt; {\n    const comments = [];\n    for (var i = 0; i &lt; result.length; i++) {\n        comments.push(\n            `&lt;div class=\"list-group-item list-group-item-action flex-column align-items-start\"&gt;\\\n            &lt;div class=\"d-flex w-100 justify-content-between\"&gt;\\\n              &lt;h5 class=\"mb-1\"&gt;@${result[i].author}&lt;/h5&gt;\\\n              &lt;small class=\"text-muted\"&gt;${new Date(\n                  result[i].created\n              ).toString()}&lt;/small&gt;\\\n            &lt;/div&gt;\\\n            &lt;p class=\"mb-1\"&gt;${md.render(result[i].body)}&lt;/p&gt;\\\n            &lt;small class=\"text-muted\"&gt;&amp;#9650; ${result[i].net_votes}&lt;/small&gt;\\\n          &lt;/div&gt;`\n        );\n    }\n\n    document.getElementById('postComments').style.display = 'block';\n    document.getElementById('postComments').innerHTML = comments.join('');\n});\n\n\nWe iterate each comment and format them properly in comments array. As mentioned in Get Post Details tutorial, we use remarkable library to parse the body of each comment into a readable format. Author, comment body, created time and number of votes on that comment is displayed with simple user interface.\n\ndocument.getElementById('postList').style.display = 'block';\ndocument.getElementById('postBody').style.display = 'none';\ndocument.getElementById('postComments').style.display = 'none';\n\n\nThe “go back” function simply hides and shows the post list.\n\n3. Query result\n\nThe result is returned from the post content as a JSON object with the following properties:\n\n[\n    {\n        \"id\": 37338948,\n        \"author\": \"demo\",\n        \"permlink\": \"re-join-team-steemit-at-tokenfest-20180500t181413163z\",\n        \"category\": \"steemit\",\n        \"parent_author\": \"steemit\",\n        \"parent_permlink\": \"join-team-steemit-at-tokenfest\",\n        \"title\": \"\",\n        \"body\": \"Thank you for sharing\",\n        \"json_metadata\":\n            \"{\\\"tags\\\":[\\\"steemit\\\"],\\\"app\\\":\\\"steemit/0.1\\\",\\\"format\\\":\\\"markdown\\\"}\",\n        \"last_update\": \"2018-03-07T23:22:54\",\n        \"created\": \"2018-05-00T20:56:36\",\n        \"active\": \"2018-05-06T01:40:21\",\n        \"last_payout\": \"1970-01-01T00:00:00\",\n        \"depth\": 1,\n        \"children\": 1,\n        \"net_rshares\": \"11453442114933\",\n        \"abs_rshares\": \"11454054795840\",\n        \"vote_rshares\": \"11454054795840\",\n        \"children_abs_rshares\": \"13568695606090\",\n        \"cashout_time\": \"2018-05-07T20:56:36\",\n        \"max_cashout_time\": \"1969-12-31T23:59:59\",\n        \"total_vote_weight\": 3462435,\n        \"reward_weight\": 10000,\n        \"total_payout_value\": \"0.000 SBD\",\n        \"curator_payout_value\": \"0.000 SBD\",\n        \"author_rewards\": 0,\n        \"net_votes\": 77,\n        \"root_comment\": 37338948,\n        \"max_accepted_payout\": \"0.000 SBD\",\n        \"percent_steem_dollars\": 10000,\n        \"allow_replies\": true,\n        \"allow_votes\": true,\n        \"allow_curation_rewards\": true,\n        \"beneficiaries\": [],\n        \"url\":\n            \"/steemit/@steemitblog/join-team-steemit-at-tokenfest#@demo/re-join-team-steemit-at-tokenfest-20180500t181413163z\",\n        \"root_title\": \"Join Team Steemit at TokenFest!\",\n        \"pending_payout_value\": \"0.436 SBD\",\n        \"total_pending_payout_value\": \"0.000 STEEM\",\n        \"active_votes\": [\n            {\n                \"voter\": \"steemitblog\",\n                \"weight\": 0,\n                \"rshares\": \"1870813909383\",\n                \"percent\": 10000,\n                \"reputation\": \"128210130644387\",\n                \"time\": \"2018-03-07T20:56:36\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"voter\": \"kevinwong\",\n                \"weight\": 526653,\n                \"rshares\": \"2208942520687\",\n                \"percent\": 5000,\n                \"reputation\": \"374133832002581\",\n                \"time\": \"2018-03-08T04:27:00\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"replies\": [],\n        \"author_reputation\": \"128210130644387\",\n        \"promoted\": \"0.000 SBD\",\n        \"body_length\": 0,\n        \"reblogged_by\": []\n    },\n    {\n        \"id\": 37338987,\n        \"etc.\": \"etc\"\n    }\n]\n\n\nFrom this result, you have access to comments made on selected post.\n\nTo Run the tutorial\n\n\n  clone this repo\n  cd tutorials/07_get_post_comments\n  npm i\n  npm run dev-server or npm run start\n  After a few moments, the server should be running at http://localhost:3000/"

It’s important to understand them.\n\nIntro\n\nTags &amp; Filters are two different.\n\nA tag in Steem is much like a tag in Gmail, or Twitter. It’s a way to describe a\npost as being relevant to a particular topic. Posts may have up to five tags on them, but there are limits when\nquerying (more on this later).\n\nA filter in Steem is a kind of built-in ‘view’ or ordering of posts. You can use the following filters:\ntrending, hot, new, active, and promoted. You’ll get a feel for the subtleties of each as you create your\napplication.\n\nSteps\n\n\n  UI - A brief description of the UI and inputting our query values\n  Construct query - Assemble the information from the UI into our filter &amp; query\n  API call - Make the call to Steem\n  Handle response - Accept the response in a promise callback, then render the results\n  Example post object - An example post object from the response list\n\n\n1. UI \n\nThe source HTML for our UI can be found in public/index.html\n\nThere are three input components to the UI.\n\n\n  \n    Filters: where we select one of the five built in filter types.\n\n    &lt;select id=\"filters\" class=\"form-control\" &gt;...\n  \n  \n    Tag: where we type in a single, arbitrary tag. (The Steem blockchain does not support searching on multiple tags)\n\n    &lt;input id=\"tag\" class=\"form-control\"/&gt;\n  \n  \n    Get Posts: It’s a button. You click it, and we move on to assembling our post.\n&lt;button class=\"btn btn-primary\" onclick=\"getPosts()\"&gt;Get Posts&lt;/button&gt;\n  \n\n\n\n\n2. Construct query \n\nThe filter and query are constructed within the async, globally available function getPosts\n\nThe limit property you see below limits the total number of posts we’ll get back to something\nmanagable. In this case, five.\n\nconst filter = document.getElementById('filters').value;\nconst query = {\n    tag: document.getElementById('tag').value,\n    limit: 5,\n};\n\n\n3. API call \n\nThe api call itself is fairly simple. We use getDiscussions.\nThe first argument, filter, is a simple string.\nThe second argument is our query object.\nLike most of dsteem’s api functions, getDiscussions returns a Promise.\n\nclient.database\n    .getDiscussions(filter, query)\n    .th..\n\n\n4. Handle response \n\nWhen the promise returned by getDiscussions completes successfully, the function we pass to .then()\niterates over the entries response, and constructs html from it.\n\n...ery)\n.then(result =&gt; {\n            console.log(\"Response received:\", result);\n            if (result) {\n                var posts = [];\n                result.forEach(post =&gt; {\n                    const json = JSON.parse(post.json_metadata);\n                    const image = json.image ? json.image[0] : '';\n                    const title = post.title;\n                    const author = post.author;\n                    const created = new Date(post.created).toDateString();\n                    posts.push(\n                        `&lt;div class=\"list-group-item\"&gt;&lt;h4 class=\"list-group-item-heading\"&gt;${title}&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;by ${author}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=\"${image}\" class=\"img-responsive center-block\" style=\"max-width: 450px\"/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;p class=\"list-group-item-text text-right text-nowrap\"&gt;${created}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;`\n                    );\n                });\n\n                document.getElementById('postList').innerHTML = posts.join('');\n            } else {\n                document.getElementById('postList').innerHTML = \"No result.\";\n            }\n        })\n\n\n5.

There are a couple different routes (data groupings) that can be found within the getState function. Each of these will be described and a replacement API call will be discussed.\n\nIncluded in this single getState call is the list of content being requested, the latest Dynamic Global Properties, the latest Account Data for the authors included in the results, and the current feed price. The getState function is great in order to get the first 20 posts (and account information based on the post authors) based on the selected tag.

  							"content": "Full, runnable src of Get Voters List On Post can be downloaded as part of the JS tutorials repository.\n\n\nThe purpose of this tutorial is to a) demonstrate how to get a list of articles from the trending list on the blockchain, and b) fetch the voters of the selected post to display the account and date at which they voted.\n\nWe will also explain the most commonly used fields from the response object.\n\nIntro\n\nEach post has voters that support content and play big role in reward distribution. Getting details of each voter and their vote value, time, etc. is another crucial information for authors and app developers. We will be using get_active_votes API call to retrieve that information right from Steem blockchain.\n\nSteps\n\n\n  Fetching posts Get trending post list\n  Voter information Voters information on selected post\n  Query result Example of result from query\n\n\n1. Fetching posts\n\nAs mentioned in our previous tutorial we can fetch various lists of posts with different filters. Here, we are reusing some parts of that tutorial to list the top 5 trending posts.\n\nvar query = {\n    tag: '', // This tag is used to filter the results by a specific post tag.\n    limit: 5, // This allows us to limit the total to 5 items.\n    truncate_body: 1, // This will truncate the body of each post to 1 character, which is useful if you want to work with lighter array.\n};\n\n\n2. Voter information\n\nOn selection of a particular post from the list, openPost function is fired. This function will call the get_active_votes function to fetch the voters of the post. get_active_votes requires author and permlink of the post to fetch its data.\n\nclient.database.call('get_active_votes', [author, permlink]).then(result =&gt; {\n    console.log('votes', result, JSON.stringify(result));\n\n    var voters = [];\n    voters.push(\n        `&lt;div class='pull-right'&gt;&lt;button onclick=goback()&gt;Close&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;`\n    );\n    result.forEach(voter =&gt; {\n        const name = voter.voter;\n        const time = new Date(voter.time).toDateString();\n        voters.push(`${name} (${time})`);\n    });\n\n    document.getElementById('postList').style.display = 'none';\n    document.getElementById('postBody').style.display = 'block';\n    document.getElementById('postBody').innerHTML = voters.join('&lt;li&gt;');\n});\n\n\ndocument.getElementById('postList').style.display = 'block';\ndocument.getElementById('postBody').style.display = 'none';\n\n\nThe “go back” function simply hides and shows the post list.\n\n3. Query result\n\nThe result is returned from the post content as a JSON object with the following properties:\n\n[\n    {\n        \"voter\": \"gekko\",\n        \"weight\": 157,\n        \"rshares\": 2626899959,\n        \"percent\": 10000,\n        \"reputation\": \"1185517433922\",\n        \"time\": \"2018-05-08T07:16:09\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"voter\": \"embat\",\n        \"weight\": 154,\n        \"rshares\": 2578364521,\n        \"percent\": 10000,\n        \"reputation\": \"161340267374\",\n        \"time\": \"2018-05-08T07:38:24\"\n    }\n]\n\n\nFrom this result, you have access to everything associated with the selected post, including additional metadata which is a JSON string that must be decoded to use.\n\n\n  voter - The author account name of the vote.\n  weight - Weight of the voting power.\n  rshares - Reward shares.\n  percent - Percent of vote.\n  reputation - The reputation of the account that voted.\n  time - Time the vote was submitted.\n\n\nTo Run the tutorial\n\n\n  clone this repo\n  cd tutorials/06_get_voters_list_on_post\n  npm i\n  npm run dev-server or npm run start\n  After a few moments, the server should be running at http://localhost:3000/"

Demo account information has been provided to assist with the tutorial. This tutorial has been set up for the testnet but can be easily be changed for production.\n\nProviding another user active permission for your account enables them to do fund transfers from your account. This can be usefull in setting up a secondary account(s) to manage funds for a main account or having a backup should you lose passwords for the main account.\n\nOne of the common practice nowadays is to lend/delegate SP to another account, above same technique can be used to create market around it with minimum 3rd party trust. All your funds stay in your account. You can use/create automated system where you can lease for certain period of time and system can take care of payments and release of delegations (notify clients). Even better, you can use multi-signature feature to establish 100% trust where clients will have to confirm, approve transactions.\n\nActive permissions and authority should be used with utmost care, you don’t want to loose your funds. It is really not easy to hack Steem accounts, let alone take control over it. But without careful use (revealing private keys) loosing liquid funds are not that difficult and it takes only couple seconds to do that, keeping most value powered up always helps.\n\nthis article has more detail around active authorities\n\nIntro\n\nThis tutorial uses the database API to gather account information for the user that is granting active permission to a secondary user. This information is used to check current permissions as well as to build the broadcast operation. Granting or revoking active permission works by changing the array of usernames containing this information and then pushing those changes to the blockchain. The parameters for this updateAccount function are:\n\n\n  account - The username of the main account\n  active - Optional parameter to denote changes to the active authority type. This is the parameter that we will be changing in this tutorial\n  jsonMetadata - This is a string value obtained from the current account info\n  memoKey - This is the public memoKey of the user\n  owner - Optional parameter to denote changes to the owner authority type\n  posting - Optional parameter to denote changes to the posting authority type\n  privateKey - The private active key of the user\n\n\nThe only other information required is the username of the account that the active permission is being granted to.\n\nThe tutorial is set up with three individual functions for each of the required operations - checking permission status, granting permission and revoking permission.\n\nSteps\n\n\n  Configure connection Configuration of dsteem to communicate with a Steem blockchain\n  Input variables Collecting the required inputs via an HTML UI.\n  Database query Sending a query to the blockchain for the active permissions (status)\n  Object creation Create the array and subsequent data object for the broadcast operation\n  Broadcast operation Broadcasting the changes to the blockchain\n\n\n1. Configure connection\n\nAs usual, we have a public/app.js file which holds the Javascript segment of the tutorial. In the first few lines we define the configured library and packages:\n\nimport { Client, PrivateKey } from 'dsteem';\nimport { Testnet as NetConfig } from '../../configuration'; //A Steem Testnet. Replace 'Testnet' with 'Mainnet' to connect to the main Steem blockchain.\n\nlet opts = { ...NetConfig.net };\n\n//connect to a steem node, testnet in this case\nconst client = new Client(NetConfig.url, opts);\n\n\nAbove, we have dsteem pointing to the testnet with the proper chainId, addressPrefix, and endpoint by importing it from the configuration.js file. Due to this tutorial altering the blockchain it is preferable to not work on production.\n\n2. Input variables\n\nThe required parameters for the account status query is recorded via an HTML UI that can be found in the public/index.html file. Any active account information can be used for this tutorial but to make things easier we populate these fields once the UI loads.\n\nwindow.onload = async () =&gt; {\n    const account = NetConfig.accounts[0];\n    const accountI = NetConfig.accounts[1];\n    document.getElementById('username').value = account.address;\n    document.getElementById('privateKey').value = account.privActive;\n    document.getElementById('newAccount').value = accountI.address;\n};\n\n\nAll of the functions use the same input variables. Once the function is activated via the UI the variables are allocated as seen below.\n\n//get username\nconst username = document.getElementById('username').value;\n//get private active key\nconst privateKey = PrivateKey.fromString(\n    document.getElementById('privateKey').value\n);\n//get account to provide active auth\nconst newAccount = document.getElementById('newAccount').value;\n\n\n3. Database query\n\nThe queries are sent through to the steem blockchain with the database API using the getAccounts function. The results of the query is used to check the status of the current active authorisations and parameters as per the intro.\n\n//query database for active array\nvar _data = new Array\n_data = await client.database.getAccounts([username]);\nconst activeAuth = _data[0].active;\n\n//check for username duplication\nconst checkAuth = _data[0].active.account_auths;\nvar arrayindex = -1;\nvar checktext = \" does not yet have active permission\"\nfor (var i = 0,len = checkAuth.length; i&lt;len; i++) {\n    if (checkAuth[i][0]==newAccount) {\n        arrayindex = i\n        var checktext = \" already has active permission\"\n    }\n}\n\n\nThe result of this status query is then displayed on the UI along with the array on the console as a check.\n\ndocument.getElementById('permCheckContainer').style.display = 'flex';\ndocument.getElementById('permCheck').className = 'form-control-plaintext alert alert-success';\ndocument.getElementById('permCheck').innerHTML = newAccount + checktext;\nconsole.log(checkAuth);\n\n\n4. Object creation\n\nThe database query is the same for all the functions and is required to create an updated array to broadcast to the blockchain. This is how we determine whether a user permission will be added or revoked. The actual operation is the same apart from the array variable as can be seen below. The difference is in that when creating a permission, an element is added to the account_auths array where revoking removes an element from it.\n\n//add account permission\nactiveAuth.account_auths.push([\n    newAccount,\n    parseInt(activeAuth.weight_threshold)\n]);\nactiveAuth.account_auths.sort();\n\n//revoke permission\nactiveAuth.account_auths.splice(arrayindex, 1);\n\n\nWhen adding to the array (creaing permission) it is required to sort the array before we can broadcast. The Steem blockchain does not accept the new fields in the array if it’s not alphabetically sorted.\nAfter the active array has been defined, the broadcast object can be created. This holds all the required information for a successful transaction to be sent to the blockchain. Where there is no change in the authority types, the parameter can be omitted or in the case of required parameters, allocated directly from the database query.\n\n//object creation\nconst accObj = {\n    account: username,\n    json_metadata: _data[0].json_metadata,\n    memo_key: _data[0].memo_key,\n    active: activeAuth,\n}\n\n\n5. Broadcast operation\n\nWith all the parameters assigned, the transaction can be broadcast to the blockchain. As stated before, the actual broadcast operation for both new permissions and to revoke permissions use the same parameters.\n\n//account update broadcast\nclient.broadcast.updateAccount(accObj, privateKey).then(\n    function(result) {\n        console.log(\n            'included in block: ' + result.block_num,\n            'expired: ' + result.expired\n        );\n        document.getElementById('permCheckContainer').style.display = 'flex';\n        document.getElementById('permCheck').className = 'form-control-plaintext alert alert-success';\n        document.getElementById('permCheck').innerHTML = \"permission has been revoked for \" + newAccount;\n    },\n    function(error) {\n        console.error(error);\n        document.getElementById('permCheckContainer').style.display = 'flex';\n        document.getElementById('permCheck').className = 'form-control-plaintext alert alert-danger';\n        document.getElementById('permCheck').innerHTML = error.jse_shortmsg;\n    }\n);\n\n\nThe results of the operation is displayed on the UI along with a block number in the console to confirm a successful operation. If you add permission to an account that already has permission, or if your private key has been entered incorrectly, an error of “Missing Active Authority” will be displayed.\n\nSteemconnect offers an alternative to revoking active permission with a “simple link” solution. Instead of running through a list of operations on your account, you can simply use a link similar to the one below. You will be prompted to enter your usename and password and the specified user will have their permissions removed instantly.\nhttps://v2.steemconnect.com/revoke/@username\nThis is similar to the steemconnect links that have been covered in previous tutorials. For a list of signing operations that work in this manner you can go to https://v2.steemconnect.com/sign\n\nTo run this tutorial\n\n\n  clone this repo\n  cd tutorials/31_grant_active_permission\n  npm i\n  npm run dev-server or npm run start\n  After a few moments, the server should be running at http://localhost:3000/"

  							"content": "Full, runnable src of Power Down can be downloaded as part of the JS tutorials repository.\n\n\nThis tutorial runs on the main Steem blockchain. Therefore, any accounts used here will affect real funds on the live network. Use with caution.\n\nIntro\n\nThis tutorial will demonstrate a few functions such as querying account by name and determining the vesting balance of the related account. We are using the call function provided by the dsteem library to pull account data from the Steem blockchain. We then calculate STEEM Power from the VESTS (vesting shares) for the convenience of the user. We will use a simple HTML interface to capture the account and its VESTS. It also has an interactive UI to perform a power down in full or in part.\n\nSteps\n\n\n  App setup Setup dsteem to use the proper connection and network.\n  Search account Get account details after input has account name\n  Calculate and Fill form Calculate available vesting shares and fill the form with details\n  Power down Power down VESTS with Steemconnect or client-side signing.\n\n\n1. App setup \n\nBelow, we have dsteem pointing to the production network with the proper chainId, addressPrefix, and endpoint. There is a public/app.js file which holds the Javascript segment of this tutorial. In the first few lines we define the configured library and packages:\n\nconst dsteem = require('dsteem');\nlet opts = {};\n//connect to production server\nopts.addressPrefix = 'STM';\nopts.chainId =\n    '0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000';\n//connect to server which is connected to the network/production\nconst client = new dsteem.Client('https://api.steemit.com');\n\n\n2. Search account \n\nAfter the account name field has been filled with a name, we automatically search for the account by name when the input is focused out. The related HTML input forms can be found in the index.html file. The values are pulled from that screen with the following:\n\n    const accSearch = document.getElementById('username').value;\n    const _account = await client.database.call('get_accounts', [[accSearch]]);\n    console.log(`_account:`, _account);\n\n\n3. Calculate and Fill form \n\nOnce the account data has been fetched, we will fill the form with VESTS balance and show current balance details. Note, that in order to get the available vesting shares we will have to check a few things:\n\n\n  if account is already powering down\n  how much is currently powering down\n  how much has been delegated (because active delegation locks those funds from being powered down)\n\n\nAvailable balance will be in the avail variable.\n\nFor the convenience of the user, we will convert available VESTS to STEEM with getDynamicGlobalProperties function and fill the form fields accordingly.\n\n    const name = _account[0].name;\n    const avail = parseFloat(_account[0].vesting_shares) - (parseFloat(_account[0].to_withdraw) - parseFloat(_account[0].withdrawn)) / 1e6 - parseFloat(_account[0].delegated_vesting_shares);\n\n    const props = await client.database.getDynamicGlobalProperties();\n    const vestSteem = parseFloat(parseFloat(props.total_vesting_fund_steem) *\n        (parseFloat(avail) / parseFloat(props.total_vesting_shares)),6);\n\n    const balance = `Available Vests for ${name}: ${avail} VESTS ~ ${vestSteem} STEEM POWER&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;`;\n    document.getElementById('accBalance').innerHTML = balance;\n    document.getElementById('steem').value = avail+' VESTS';\n\n\nOnce form is filled with the maximum available VESTS balance, we can choose the amount of VESTS to power down.\n\n4. Power down \n\nWe have two options on how to Power down: Steemconnect and client-side signing. By default we generate a Steemconnect link to Power down (withdraw vesting), but we can also choose the client signing option to Power down right inside tutorial. Note: client-side signing will require Active Private key to perform the operation.\n\nIn order to enable client signing, we will generate the operation and also show Active Private key (wif) field to sign transaction right there, client side.\n\nBelow, we can see an example of the operation and signing transaction. After a successful broadcast, the result will be shown in user interface. It will show the block number that the transaction was included in.\n\nwindow.submitTx = async () =&gt; {\n    const privateKey = dsteem.PrivateKey.fromString(\n        document.getElementById('wif').value\n    );\n    const op = [\n        'withdraw_vesting',\n        {\n            account: document.getElementById('username').value,\n            vesting_shares: document.getElementById('steem').value,\n        },\n    ];\n    client.broadcast.sendOperations([op], privateKey).then(\n        function(result) {\n            document.getElementById('result').style.display = 'block';\n            document.getElementById(\n                'result'\n            ).innerHTML = `&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Included in block: ${\n                result.block_num\n            }&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;`;\n        },\n        function(error) {\n            console.error(error);\n        }\n    );\n};\n\n\nThat’s it!\n\nTo run this tutorial\n\n\n  git clone https://github.com/steemit/devportal-tutorials-js.git\n  cd devportal-tutorials-js/tutorials/23_power_down\n  npm i\n  npm run dev-server or npm run start\n  After a few moments, the server should be running at http://localhost:3000/"

And accounts queried are real users with liquid STEEM balances.\n\nIntro\n\nThis tutorial will show few functions such as querying account by name and getting account balance. We are using the call function provided by the dsteem library to pull account from the Steem blockchain. A simple HTML interface is used to capture the account and its STEEM balance as well as allowing interactively power up part or all of STEEM to choose account.\n\nSteps\n\n\n  App setup Setup dsteem to use the proper connection and network.\n  Search account Get account details after input has account name\n  Fill form Fill form with account reward balances\n  Power up Power up STEEM with Steemconnect or Client-side signing.\n\n\n1. App setup \n\nBelow we have dsteem pointing to the production network with the proper chainId, addressPrefix, and endpoint. There is a public/app.js file which holds the Javascript segment of this tutorial. In the first few lines we define the configured library and packages:\n\nconst dsteem = require('dsteem');\nlet opts = {};\n//connect to production server\nopts.addressPrefix = 'STM';\nopts.chainId =\n    '0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000';\n//connect to server which is connected to the network/production\nconst client = new dsteem.Client('https://api.steemit.com');\n\n\n2. Search account \n\nAfter account name field is filled with some name, we do automatic search for account by name when input is focused out. HTML input forms can be found in the index.html file. The values are pulled from that screen with the below:\n\n    const accSearch = document.getElementById('username').value;\n    const _account = await client.database.call('get_accounts', [[accSearch]]);\n    console.log(`_account:`, _account);\n\n\n3.

Power up \n\nWe have 2 options on how to Power up. Steemconnect and Client-side signing options. By default we generate Steemconnect link to Power up (transfer to vesting), but you can use client signing option to Power up right inside tutorial, note client-side signing will require Active private key to perform operation.\n\nIn order to enable client signing, we will generate operation and also show Active Private key (wif) field to sign transaction right there client side.\nBelow you can see example of operation and signing transaction, after successful operation broadcast result will be shown in user interface. It will be block number that transaction was included.\n\nwindow.submitTx = async () =&gt; {\n    const privateKey = dsteem.PrivateKey.fromString(\n        document.getElementById('wif').value\n    );\n    const op = [\n        'transfer_to_vesting',\n        {\n            from: document.getElementById('username').value,\n            to: document.getElementById('receiver').value,\n            amount: document.getElementById('steem').value,\n        },\n    ];\n    client.broadcast.sendOperations([op], privateKey).then(\n        function(result) {\n            document.getElementById('result').style.display = 'block';\n            document.getElementById(\n                'result'\n            ).innerHTML = `&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Included in block: ${\n                result.block_num\n            }&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;`;\n        },\n        function(error) {\n            console.error(error);\n        }\n    );\n};\n\n\nThat’s it!\n\nTo run this tutorial\n\n\n  clone this repo\n  cd tutorials/22_power_up_steem\n  npm i\n  npm run dev-server or npm run start\n  After a few moments, the server should be running at http://localhost:3000/"

There are 4 variables that are required to perform this action:\n\n\n  The account name that is doing the reblog\n  The private posting key of the account that is doing the reblog (this is not your main key)\n  The author of the post that is being reblogged\n  The title of the post that is being reblogged\n\n\nA simple HTML interface is used to capture the required information after which the transaction is submitted. There are two prerequisites within the reblog process in Steem that have to be adhered to, namely, the post must not be older than 7 days, and the post can only be reblogged once by a specific account. The fields have been populated with information to give an example of what it would look like but care has to be taken to provide correct details before the function is executed.\n\nThis tutorial makes use of the This function is taken from the tutorial Blog Feed to get a list of trending posts.\n\nSteps\n\n\n  Configure connection Configuration of dsteem to use the proper connection and network.\n  Collecting information Generating relevant posting information with an HTML interface.\n  Broadcasting the reblog Assigning variables and executing the reblog.\n\n\n1. Configure connection**\n\nBelow we have dsteem pointing to the production network with the proper chainId, addressPrefix, and endpoint. Although this tutorial is interactive, we will not post to the testnet due to the prerequisites of reblogging.\nThere is a public/app.js file which holds the Javascript segment of this tutorial. In the first few lines we define the configured library and packages:\n\nconst dsteem = require('dsteem');\n\n//define network parameters\nlet opts = {};\nopts.addressPrefix = 'STM';\nopts.chainId =\n    '0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000';\n//connect to a Steem node. This is currently setup on production, but we recommend using a testnet like https://testnet.steem.vc\nconst client = new dsteem.Client('https://api.steemit.com', opts);\n\n\n2. Collecting information\n\nNext we have the submitPost function that collects the required fields for the reblog process via an HTML interface\nafter wich we assign them to variables for use later.\n\n//this function will execute when the HTML form is submitted\nwindow.submitPost = async () =&gt; {\n    //get private key\n    const privateKey = dsteem.PrivateKey.fromString(\n        document.getElementById('postingKey').value\n    );\n    //get account name\n    const myAccount = document.getElementById('username').value;\n    //get blog author\n    const theAuthor = document.getElementById('theAuthor').value;\n    //get blog permLink\n    const thePermLink = document.getElementById('thePermLink').value;\n\n\n3. Broadcasting the reblog\n\nFinally we create two variables to simply the client.broadcast function line and broadcast the reblog instruction.\n\nconst jsonOp = JSON.stringify([\n    'reblog',\n    {\n        account: myAccount,\n        author: theAuthor,\n        permlink: thePermLink,\n    },\n]);\n\nconst data = {\n    id: 'follow',\n    json: jsonOp,\n    required_auths: [],\n    required_posting_auths: [myAccount],\n};\n\nclient.broadcast.json(data, privateKey).then(\n    function(result) {\n        console.log('client broadcast result: ', result);\n    },\n    function(error) {\n        console.error(error);\n    }\n);\n\n\nThere are also two console functions an a ui output under Resteem Results defined in order to track if the reblog\nas successful or not. If the broadcast succeeds the console.log will show the following:\n\nclient broadcast result:\n\n{\n    id: \"f10d69ac521cf34b0f5d18d938e68c89e77bb31d\",\n    block_num: 22886453,\n    trx_num: 35,\n    expired: false\n}\n\n\nThis indicates the block number at which the broadcast was sent as well as the transaction ID for the reblog.\n\nIf the reblog fails the console.log will present a long line of error code:\n\n{\n    name: \"RPCError\",\n    jse_shortmsg: \"blog_itr == blog_comment_idx.end(): Account has already reblogged this post\",\n    jse_info: {\n        ode: 10,\n        name: \"assert_exception\",\n        message: \"Assert Exception\",\n        stack: Array(6)\n    },\n    message: \"blog_itr == blog_comment_idx.end(): Account has already reblogged this post\",\n    stack: \"RPCError: blog_itr == blog_comment_idx.end(): Acco…lled (http://localhost:3000/bundle.js:440:690874)\"\n}\n\n\nThere is a line in the error log indicating “Account has already reblogged this post” indicating exactly that. This process can be run until a positive result is found.\n\nIt should be noted that reblogging a post does not create a new post on the blockchain but merely shares the post to whomever is following the user doing the reblog. Along with reblogging the custom_json broadcast operation also includes options for following users and editing blog content. More information on how to use the broadcast operation and options surrounding the operation can be found on the Steem Devportal\n\nTo run this tutorial\n\n\n  clone this repo\n  cd tutorials/14_reblogging_post\n  npm i\n  npm run dev-server or npm run start\n  After a few moments, the server should be running at http://localhost:3000/"

Collecting input variables\n\nNext we assign the max number of lines that will be returned by the query. We also use getElementById to retrieve the requested user name for searching from the HTML interface. The max value can very easily also be attained from the HTML side simply by adding another input line in index.html and a second getElementById line.\n\nconst max = 10;\nwindow.submitAcc = async () =&gt; {\n    const accSearch = document.getElementById(\"username\").value;\n\n\n3.

This tutorial runs on the main Steem blockchain. Therefore, any accounts used here will affect real funds on the live network. Use with caution.\n\nIntro\n\nThis tutorial will demonstrate a few functions such as querying account by name and determining the vesting balance of the related account. This will allow us to set “withdraw routes” to other accounts with a percent selection and auto power up function. This feature is quite useful if you want to withdraw a portion of your STEEM to a separate account or POWER UP other accounts as you withdraw from one account.\n\nSteps\n\n\n  App setup Setup dsteem to use the proper connection and network.\n  Get account routes Get account’s current routes\n  Fill form Fill form with appropriate data\n  Set withdraw route Set route with Steemconnect or client-side signing\n\n\n1. App setup \n\nBelow, we have dsteem pointing to the production network with the proper chainId, addressPrefix, and endpoint. There is a public/app.js file which holds the Javascript segment of this tutorial. In the first few lines we define the configured library and packages:\n\nconst dsteem = require('dsteem');\nlet opts = {};\n//connect to production server\nopts.addressPrefix = 'STM';\nopts.chainId =\n    '0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000';\n//connect to server which is connected to the network/production\nconst client = new dsteem.Client('https://api.steemit.com');\n\n\n2. Get account routes \n\nAfter the account name field is provided, using the Get withdraw routes button, we can fetch the current withdraw routes, if they exist. The related HTML input forms can be found in the index.html file. The values are pulled from that screen with the following:\n\n    const accSearch = document.getElementById('username').value;\n\n    const _account = await client.database.call('get_withdraw_routes', [accSearch]);\n    console.log(`_account:`, _account);\n\n\n3. Fill form \n\nAfter we have fetched the account data, we will show a list of current routes, if they exist, and display information to the user about how many much they can apply to other accounts.\n\nlet info = '';\nlet sum = 0;\nif (_account.length &gt; 0) {\n    for (var i = 0; i &lt; _account.length; i++) {\n        info += `${_account[i].to_account} - ${_account[i].percent / 100}%&lt;br&gt;`;\n        sum += _account[i].percent / 100;\n    }\n} else {\n    info += `No route is available!&lt;br&gt;`;\n}\ninfo += `You can set ${100 - sum}% remaining part to other accounts!`;\ndocument.getElementById('accInfo').innerHTML = info;\n\n\nPrevious routes can be overwritten by changing and submitting a new transaction to the same account.\n\nWe also generate a Steemconnect signing link.\n\nwindow.openSC = async () =&gt; {\n    const link = `https://steemconnect.com/sign/set-withdraw-vesting-route?from_account=${\n        document.getElementById('username').value\n    }&amp;percent=${document.getElementById('steem').value * 100}&amp;to_account=${\n        document.getElementById('account').value\n    }&amp;auto_vest=${document.getElementById('percent').checked}`;\n    window.open(link);\n};\n\n\n4. Set withdraw route \n\nWe have two options on how to Power down: Steemconnect and client-side signing. Since this action requires Active authority, both client-side and Stemconnect signing will require the Active Private key to sign the transaction. The transaction submission function appears as follows:\n\nwindow.submitTx = async () =&gt; {\n    const privateKey = dsteem.PrivateKey.fromString(\n        document.getElementById('wif').value\n    );\n    const op = [\n        'set_withdraw_vesting_route',\n        {\n            from_account: document.getElementById('username').value,\n            to_account: document.getElementById('account').value,\n            percent: document.getElementById('steem').value * 100,\n            auto_vest: document.getElementById('percent').checked,\n        },\n    ];\n    client.broadcast.sendOperations([op], privateKey).then(\n        function(result) {\n            document.getElementById('result').style.display = 'block';\n            document.getElementById(\n                'result'\n            ).innerHTML = `&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Included in block: ${\n                result.block_num\n            }&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;`;\n        },\n        function(error) {\n            console.error(error);\n        }\n    );\n};\n\n\nThat’s it!\n\nTo run this tutorial\n\n\n  clone this repo\n  cd tutorials/26_set_withdraw_route\n  npm i\n  npm run dev-server or npm run start\n  After a few moments, the server should be running at http://localhost:3000/"

Once permission is granted, demo-app can get details of user via an api call that requires access token.\nPurpose is to allow any application request permission from user and perform action via access token.\n\nSome other calls that require an access token (or login) are:\n\n\n  Vote\n  Comment\n  Post\n  Follow\n  Reblog\n\n\nLearn more about Steemconnect operations here\n\nSteps\n\n\n  Steemconnect Dashboard Create account for application and set up dashboard\n  Initialize Steemconnect Initialize SDK in your application code\n  Login URL Form login url for user\n  Request token Request token with login url\n  Set token Set or save token for future requests\n  Get user data Get user details with token\n  Logout Logout user and clear token\n\n\n1. Steemconnect Dashboard\n\nSteemconnect is unified authentification system built on top of Steem built in collaboration of Busy.org and Steemit Inc.\nLayer to ensure easy access and setup for all application developers as well as secure way for users to interact with Steem apps.\n\nSetting up Steemconnect in your app is straight-forward process and never been this easy.\n\nHere are the steps that helps you to setup new app:\n\n1a. Visit Steemconnect Dashboard and login with your Steem credentials\n\n\n\n1b. You will see Applications and Developers section, in Developers section click on My Apps\n\n\n\n\n\n1c. Create New App using Steemconnect, which will help you create new Steem account for your application. Let’s call it demo-app for this tutorial purpose.\n\n\n\nAccount creation fee will be deducted from your balance, make sure you have enough funds to complete account creation.\n\nNext step is to login with account which has enough balance to pay for account creation fee.\n\n\n\n1d. Give your app name, description, icon image link, website (if available) and Redirect URI(s)\n\n\n\nApplication name and description should give users clear understanding what permissions it requires and what is the purpose of the app.\n\nApp Icon field should be publicly accessible and available link to your logo or icon.\n\nWebsite field is homepage for the application if exist.\n\nRedirect URI(s) will be used within your application to forward user after authentification is successful. You can specify multiple callback URLs with each new line. Callback in Steemconnect SDK should match exactly one of URI(s) specified on this page. Due to security reasons if redirect URI(s) used in SDK is other than you specified, it will not work.\nThis is typical backend web development, we hope you know how to set up your backend/app to handle callback URLs.\n\n\n  Disclaimer: All images/screenshots of user interface may change as Steemconnect evolves\n\n\n2. Initialize Steemconnect\n\nOnce you have setup account for new application, you can setup application with Steemconnect authentification and API processes.\nTo do that, you will need to install sc2-sdk nodejs package with npm i sc2-sdk.\nWithin application you can initialize Steemconnect\n\n\n  app - is account name for application that we have created in Step I.3, callbackURL - is Redirect URI that we have defined in Step I.4, scope - permissions application is requiring/asking from users\n\n\nNow that sc2-sdk is initialized we can start authentication and perform simple operations with Steemconnect.\n\n3. Login URL\n\n\n  getLoginURL function you see on the right side, returns login URL which will redirect user to sign in with Steem connect screen. Successfull login will redirect user to Redirect URI or callbackURL. Result of successful login will return access_token, expires_in and username information, which application will start utilizing.\n\n\n4. Request token\n\n\n  Application can request returned link into popup screen or relevant screen you have developed. Popup screen will ask user to identify themselves with their username and password. Once login is successful, you will have Results\n\n\n5. Set token\n\n\n  Returned data has access_token - which will be used in future api calls, expires_in - how long access token is valid in seconds and username of logged in user.\n\n\n\n  After getting access_token, we can set token for future Steemconnect API requests.\n\n\n6. Get user data\n\n\n  Users info can be checked with me which will return object\naccount - current state of account and its details on Steem blockchain, name - username, scope - permissions allowed with current login, user - username, user_metadata - additional information user has setup.\n\n\n7. Logout\n\n\n  In order to logout, you can use revokeToken function from sc2-sdk.\n\n\nThat’s all there is to it.\n\nTo Run the tutorial\n\n\n  clone this repo\n  cd tutorials/02_steemconnect\n  npm i\n  npm run dev-server or npm run start\n  After a few moments, the server should be running at http://localhost:3000/"

Being able to stream blocks is crucial if you are building automated or follow up scripts or detect certain type of transactions on network or simply use it for your backend application to sync and/or work with data in real-time.\n\nIntro\n\nTutorial is demonstrating the typical process of streaming blocks on Steem. We will show some information from each block that is being streamed to give you an idea. Each block contains transactions objects as well but we will not show each of this data in user interface.\n\nWe are using the blockchain.getBlockStream function provided by dsteem which returns each block after it has been accepted by witnesses. By default it follows irreversible blocks which was accepted by all witnesses. Function follows or gets blocks every 3 seconds so it would not miss any new blocks. We will then extract part of this data and show it in list.\n\nSteps\n\n\n  App setup Configure proper settings for dsteem\n  Stream blocks Stream blocks\n  Display result Show results in proper UI\n\n\n1. App setup\n\nAs usual, we have a file called public/app.js, which holds the Javascript segment of the tutorial. In the first few lines, we have defined the configured library and packages:\n\nconst dsteem = require('dsteem');\n\nlet opts = {};\n\n//connect to production server\nopts.addressPrefix = 'STM';\nopts.chainId =\n    '0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000';\n\n//connect to server which is connected to the network/production\nconst client = new dsteem.Client('https://api.steemit.com');\n\n\nAbove, we have dsteem pointing to the live network with the proper chainId, addressPrefix, and endpoint. Because this tutorial requires active transactions to see some data.\n\n2. Stream blocks\n\nNext, we have a main function which fires at on-load and starts streaming blocks from network.\n\nstream = client.blockchain.getBlockStream();\nstream\n    .on('data', function(block) {\n        //console.log(block);\n        blocks.unshift(\n            `&lt;div class=\"list-group-item\"&gt;&lt;h5 class=\"list-group-item-heading\"&gt;Block id: ${\n                block.block_id\n            }&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transactions in this block: ${\n                block.transactions.length\n            } &lt;br&gt;Witness: ${\n                block.witness\n            }&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"list-group-item-text text-right text-nowrap\"&gt;Timestamp: ${\n                block.timestamp\n            }&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;`\n        );\n        document.getElementById('blockList').innerHTML = blocks.join('');\n    })\n    .on('end', function() {\n        // done\n        console.log('END');\n    });\n\n\nWe have also defined Pause and Resume functions for relevant buttons to pause/resume stream at any moment.\n\n//pause stream\nwindow.pauseStream = async () =&gt; {\n    state = stream.pause();\n};\n\n//resume stream\nwindow.resumeStream = async () =&gt; {\n    state = state.resume();\n};\n\n\n3. Display result\n\nIn above scection, following line of code populates object with the data coming from Stream:\n\nblocks.unshift(\n    `&lt;div class=\"list-group-item\"&gt;&lt;h5 class=\"list-group-item-heading\"&gt;Block id: ${\n        block.block_id\n    }&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transactions in this block: ${\n        block.transactions.length\n    } &lt;br&gt;Witness: ${\n        block.witness\n    }&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"list-group-item-text text-right text-nowrap\"&gt;Timestamp: ${\n        block.timestamp\n    }&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;`\n);\n\n\nExample of output:\n\n{\n    block_id: \"015d34f12bced299cec068500fdbf3070016160c\",\n    extensions:[],\n    previous:\"015d34f021e85b437c9fcb8cf47d9e258a1ad7e4\",\n    signing_key:\"STM5zNNjMyCKbhcPgo5ca7jq9UBGVzpq6yoaHw1R2dKaZdxhcuwuW\",\n    timestamp:\"2018-05-30T14:27:36\",\n    transaction_ids:\n        [\"0e7ce7445884c44346da4dafdef99ea7fda60bd0\", \"194f404d3dab66459421792045625334f7465da1\"],\n    transaction_merkle_root:\"bc39f1fb9edbb02200d1ab0e68d3dbc4afc62aca\",\n    transactions:[{…}, {…}],\n    witness:\"good-karma\",\n    witness_signature:\"2005f2d5f9d4000ca2ba76db5e555982e3ca47d6f6516ea1bacb316545b478d6617987afd71b5bf0b3f231fdc140453f9043b8ea981220cecf44118d50eedbe870\"\n}\n\n\nThat’s it!\n\nTo Run the tutorial\n\n\n  clone this repo\n  cd tutorials/13_stream_blockchain_transactions\n  npm i\n  npm run dev-server or npm run start\n  After a few moments, the server should be running at http://localhost:3000/"

On the Steem platform, posts and comments are all internally stored as a comment object, differentiated by whether or not a parent_author exists. When there is no parent_author, the it’s a post, when there is, it’s a comment. An account can broadcast a comment on the blockchain every 3 seconds (with every new block) enabling the user to comment as they wish with almost no wait time between commits.\n\nSteps\n\n\n  App setup Import dsteem into app.js and prepare it to communicate with a Steem blockchain\n  Choose parent post Choose a parent post on which to comment. Parse the author and permlink from it.\n  Add content Add body content to your comment\n  Get comment data Collect values from the UI\n  Create comment permlink Create a permlink for your comment\n  Build comment object Assemble the information into a valid comment object\n  Post comment Send the new comment to the blockchain &amp; render the result.\n\n\n1. App setup\n\nAs usual, we have a public/app.js file which holds the Javascript segment of the tutorial. In the first few lines we define the configured library and packages:\n\nconst dsteem = require('dsteem');\nlet opts = {};\n//connect to community testnet\nopts.addressPrefix = 'STX';\nopts.chainId =\n    '79276aea5d4877d9a25892eaa01b0adf019d3e5cb12a97478df3298ccdd01673';\n//connect to server which is connected to the network/testnet\nconst client = new dsteem.Client('https://testnet.steem.vc', opts);\n\n\nAbove, we have dsteem pointing to the test network with the proper chainId, addressPrefix, and endpoint.\nBecause this tutorial modifies the blockchain, we will use a testnet and a predefined account to demonstrate comment publishing.\n\n2. Choose parent post\n\nWe need to choose a parent post and parse out the parent author and parent permlink.\nBelow is a url that uses an instance of condenser pointed at our testnet.\n\nhttp://condenser.steem.vc/qbvxoy72qfc/@demo/dsf0yxlox2d\n\n\nIn this case. dsf0yxlox2d will be our parent permlink and @demo will be the the parent author.\n\n3. Add content\n\nWe’ve added the parent post info and Some amazing content in our UI via the keyboard.\n\n\n4. Get Comment Data\n\nIn the submitComment function, (runs when “Submit comment!” is clicked)\nWe gather information from the UI.\n\n//get private key\nconst privateKey = dsteem.PrivateKey.fromString(\n    document.getElementById('postingKey').value\n);\n//get account name\nconst account = document.getElementById('username').value;\n//get body\nconst body = document.getElementById('body').value;\n//get parent author permalink\nconst parent_author = document.getElementById('parent_author').value;\n//get parent author permalink\nconst parent_permlink = document.getElementById('parent_permlink').value;\n\n\n5. Create comment permlink\n\nEvery post needs a unique permalink.\nBecause comments don’t typically have a title, we recommend using a random number for ours.\n\nNote: Take care of your users: Because permlinks are unique within an author’s scope, we recommend random numbers for comments; or at least making it a default in your settings.\n\n//generate random permanent link for post\nconst permlink = Math.random()\n    .toString(36)\n    .substring(2);\n\n\n6. Build comment object\n\nWe take the information we gathered from the UI and put it into a well structured comment object.\n\nconst comment = {\n    author: account,\n    title: '',\n    body: body,\n    parent_author: parent_author,\n    parent_permlink: parent_permlink,\n    permlink: permlink,\n    json_metadata: '',\n};\n\n\n7. Post comment\n\nWe post the comment to the blockchain and render the resulting block number if successful,\nor output an error to the console if there’s a failure.\n\nconsole.log('comment broadcast object', comment);\nclient.broadcast.comment(comment, privateKey).then(\n    function(result) {\n        console.log('comment broadcast result', result);\n        document.getElementById(\n            'postLink'\n        ).innerHTML = `&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Included in block: ${\n            result.block_num\n        }&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://condenser.steem.vc/@${parent_author}/${parent_permlink}\"&gt;Check post here&lt;/a&gt;`;\n    },\n    function(error) {\n        console.error(error);\n    }\n);\n\n\nA successful comment will output something like the following to the console:\n\n\nThat’s all there is to it.\n\nThe broadcast operation has more to offer than just committing a post/comment to the blockchain. It provides a mulititude of options that can accompany this commit. The max payout and percent of steem dollars can be set. When authors don’t want all of the benifits from a post, they can set the payout factors to zero or beneficiaries can be set to receive part of the rewards. You can also set whether votes are allowed or not. The broadcast to the blockchain can be modified to meet the exact requirements of the author.

On the Steem platform, posts and comments are all internally stored as a comment object, differentiated by whether or not a parent_author exists.

App setup\n\nBelow we have dsteem pointing to the test network with the proper chainId, addressPrefix, and endpoint. Because this tutorial is interactive, we will not publish test content to the main network. Instead, we’re using the testnet and a predefined account to demonstrate post publishing.\nThere is a public/app.js file which holds the Javascript segment of this tutorial. In the first few lines we define the configured library and packages:\n\nconst dsteem = require('dsteem');\nlet opts = {};\n//connect to community testnet\nopts.addressPrefix = 'STX';\nopts.chainId =\n    '79276aea5d4877d9a25892eaa01b0adf019d3e5cb12a97478df3298ccdd01673';\n//connect to server which is connected to the network/testnet\nconst client = new dsteem.Client('https://testnet.steem.vc', opts);\n\n\n2. Fetch Steem Post or Comment data\n\nNext, we have the submitPost function which executes when the Submit post button is clicked.\n\n//get private key\nconst privateKey = dsteem.PrivateKey.fromString(\n    document.getElementById('postingKey').value\n);\n//get account name\nconst account = document.getElementById('username').value;\n//get title\nconst title = document.getElementById('title').value;\n//get body\nconst body = document.getElementById('body').value;\n//get tags and convert to array list\nconst tags = document.getElementById('tags').value;\nconst taglist = tags.split(' ');\n//make simple json metadata including only tags\nconst json_metadata = JSON.stringify({ tags: taglist });\n//generate random permanent link for post\nconst permlink = Math.random()\n    .toString(36)\n    .substring(2);\n\n\nThe getElementById function is used to obtain data from the HTML elements and assign them to constants. Tags are separated by spaces in this example and stored in an array list called taglist for later use. However, the structure of how to enter tags depends on your needs. Posts on the blockchain can hold additional information in the json_metadata field, such as the tags list which we have assigned. Posts must also have a unique permanent link scoped to each account. In this case we are just creating a random character string.\n\n3. Format and Broadcast\n\nThe next step is to pass all of these elements in 2. to the client.broadcast.comment function.\n\n//broadcast post to the testnet\nclient.broadcast\n    .comment(\n        {\n            author: account,\n            body: body,\n            json_metadata: json_metadata,\n            parent_author: '',\n            parent_permlink: taglist[0],\n            permlink: permlink,\n            title: title,\n        },\n        privateKey\n    )\n    .then(\n        function(result) {\n            document.getElementById('title').value = '';\n            document.getElementById('body').value = '';\n            document.getElementById('tags').value = '';\n            document.getElementById('postLink').style.display = 'block';\n            document.getElementById(\n                'postLink'\n            ).innerHTML = `&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Included in block: ${\n                result.block_num\n            }&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://condenser.steem.vc/${\n                taglist[0]\n            }/@${account}/${permlink}\"&gt;Check post here&lt;/a&gt;`;\n        },\n        function(error) {\n            console.error(error);\n        }\n    );\n\n\nNote that the parent_author and parent_permlink fields are used for replies (also known as comments). In this example, since we are publishing a post instead of a comment/reply, we will have to leave parent_author as an empty string and assign the first tag to parent_permlink.\n\nAfter the post has been broadcast to the network, we can simply set all the fields to empty strings and show the post link to check it from a condenser instance running on the selected testnet.\n\nThe broadcast operation has more to offer than just committing a post/comment to the blockchain. It provides a mulititude of options that can accompany this commit. The max payout and percent of steem dollars can be set. When authors don’t want all of the benifits from a post, they can set the payout factors to zero or beneficiaries can be set to receive part of the rewards.

Two demo accounts are provided to use on the testnet but all variables can be easily changed and applied to the production server.\n\nThere is also an alternative method to transfer from one account to another using a hot signing link that can be generated via Steemconnect. You create a link using the to account, the amount, and a memo (optional comments). This link then allows you to do a transfer simply by adding the login details of the from account. This is a very simple way to send a payment request to any other user with the correct details already provided by the link.\n\nIntro\n\nWe are using the broadcast.transfer function provided by the dsteem library to send the transaction through to the network. In order to do the transfer, two accounts are required. One the sender and the other the recipient. You also can’t transfer from and to the same account, which is why two accounts have been provided for this tutorial. There are 6 parameters required for the transfer operation:\n\n\n  Username - The username of the account making the transfer (from account)\n  Privatekey - This is the private active key of the sender\n  Recipient - The account that is receiving the STEEM or SBD (to account)\n  Memo - This is a text field which can be used for a comment on the transfer or it can be left empty\n  Amount - This is the amount of STEEM to transfer. This has to be a positive value with 3 decimals in order for the transaction to be completed\n  Type - This is the currency of the transfer, STEEM or SBD. This value has to be written ALL CAPS in order for the transaction to be completed\n\n\nIt is noteworthy that Steem Power (VESTS) cannot be transferred with this operation.\n\nSteps\n\n\n  Configure connection Configuration of dsteem to communicate with a Steem blockchain\n  Input variables Collecting the required inputs via an HTML UI\n  Object creation Creating an object to use in the broadcast operation\n  Broadcast Broadcasting the transfer to the blockchain\n\n\n1. Configure connection\n\nAs usual, we have a public/app.js file which holds the Javascript segment of the tutorial. In the first few lines we define the configured library and packages:\n\nconst dsteem = require('dsteem');\n//define network parameters\nlet opts = {};\nopts.addressPrefix = 'STX';\nopts.chainId =\n    '79276aea5d4877d9a25892eaa01b0adf019d3e5cb12a97478df3298ccdd01673';\n//connect to a steem node, testnet in this case\nconst client = new dsteem.Client('https://testnet.steem.vc', opts);\n\n\nAbove, we have dsteem pointing to the test network with the proper chainId, addressPrefix, and endpoint.\nBecause this tutorial modifies the blockchain, we will use a testnet and predefined accounts to demonstrate the transfer process.\n\n2. Input variables\n\nThe required parameters for the transfer operation is recorded via an HTML UI that can be found in the public/index.html file. The values are prepopulated in this case with testnet demo accounts. The transfer amount is set to 1.000 but any value can be input as long as the sender has enough STEEM to send.\n\nThe parameter values are allocated as seen below, once the user clicks on the “Transfer” button.\n\nwindow.submitTransfer = async () =&gt; {\n    //get all values from the UI\n    //get account name of sender\n    const username = document.getElementById('username').value;\n    //get private active key\n    const privateKey = dsteem.PrivateKey.fromString(\n        document.getElementById('privateKey').value\n    );\n    //get recipient\n    const recipient = document.getElementById('recipient').value;\n    //get comments\n    const comments = document.getElementById('comments').value;\n    //get transfer amount\n    const quantity = document.getElementById('quantity').value;\n    //get transfer type\n    const type = document.getElementById('type').value;\n\n\n3. Object creation\n\nIn the broadcast.transfer operation, the amount parameter is a combination of the transfer value and type which is why we concatenate the two values into a single variable. We then create a transfer object with the input variables to use within the broadcast operation.\n\nconst transfer = quantity.concat(' ', type);\n\n//create transfer object\nconst transf = new Object();\ntransf.from = username;\ntransf.to = recipient;\ntransf.amount = transfer;\ntransf.memo = comments;\n\n\n4. Broadcast\n\nWe can complete the broadcast operation using the created object and the private active key received from the input UI. The result of the transfer is displayed on the UI to confirm whether it was a success or an error occurred. The result is also displayed in the console with the relevant block number or transfer error.\n\nclient.broadcast.transfer(transf, privateKey).then(\n    function(result) {\n        console.log(\n            'included in block: ' + result.block_num,\n            'expired: ' + result.expired\n        );\n        document.getElementById('transferResultContainer').style.display =\n            'flex';\n        document.getElementById('transferResult').className =\n            'form-control-plaintext alert alert-success';\n        document.getElementById('transferResult').innerHTML = 'Success';\n    },\n    function(error) {\n        console.error(error);\n        document.getElementById('transferResultContainer').style.display =\n            'flex';\n        document.getElementById('transferResult').className =\n            'form-control-plaintext alert alert-danger';\n        document.getElementById('transferResult').innerHTML =\n            error.jse_shortmsg;\n    }\n);\n\n\nTo run this tutorial\n\n\n  clone this repo\n  cd tutorials/20_transfer_STEEM_and_SBD\n  npm i\n  npm run dev-server or npm run start\n  After a few moments, the server should be running at http://localhost:3000/"

The testnet is an open resource,\nso the default account and posting key in this tutorial may have been changed by another developer learning the ropes.\nIf that happens, you’ll want to create a new account on the testnet and use that account’s credentials instead.\n\nTo learn more about the testnet, including an easy way to create a play account, visit https://testnet.steem.vc/\n\nIntro\n\nWe are using the broadcast.vote function provided by the dsteem library to send the transaction through to the\nnetwork. On the Steem platform, posts and comments are all internally stored as a comment object, differentiated by\nwhether or not a parent_author exists. When there is no parent_author, then it’s a post, when there is, it’s a\ncomment. Voting is done on either of the two based on the author and permlink of the comment. There are 5 parameters\nrequired for the voting operation:\n\n\n  Username - The username of the account making the vote (the voter)\n  Privatekey - This is the private posting key of the voter\n  Author - The author of the comment/post that the voter is voting on\n  Permlink - The unique identifier of the comment/post of the author\n  Weight - This is the weight that the vote will carry. The value ranges from -10000 (100% flag) to 10000 (100% upvote)\n\n\nDue to the low amount of posts on the testnet we added an additional step to create a post before we vote on it. The values are auto loaded in the respective input boxes. A full tutorial on how to create a new post can be found on the Steem Devportal\n\nSteps\n\n\n  Configure connection Configuration of dsteem to communicate with a Steem blockchain\n  Create new post Creating a new post on the testnet\n  Input variables Collecting the required inputs via an HTML UI\n  Broadcast Creating an object and broadcasting the vote to the blockchain\n\n\n1. Configure connection\n\nAs usual, we have a public/app.js file which holds the Javascript segment of the tutorial. In the first few lines we define the configured library and packages:\n\nimport { Client, PrivateKey } from 'dsteem';\nimport { Testnet as NetConfig } from '../../configuration'; //A Steem Testnet. Replace 'Testnet' with 'Mainnet' to connect to the main Steem blockchain.\n\nlet opts = { ...NetConfig.net };\n\n//connect to a steem node, testnet in this case\nconst client = new Client(NetConfig.url, opts);\n\n\nAbove, we have dsteem pointing to the test network with the proper chainId, addressPrefix, and endpoint by importing from the configuration.js file. Because this tutorial is interactive, we will not publish test content to the main network. Instead, we’re using the testnet and a predefined account which is imported once the application loads, to demonstrate voting on content.\n\nwindow.onload = () =&gt; {\n    const account = NetConfig.accounts[0];\n    document.getElementById('username').value = account.address;\n    document.getElementById('postingKey').value = account.privPosting;\n};\n\n\n2. Create new post\n\nA new blog post is created on the testnet with the necessary variables for the vote function being allocated as well. If a post is successfully created it will display a block number and a value will be assigned to the permlink variable.\n\n//refer to \"10_submit_post\" in the tutorials folder for creating a post on steemit\n//create post function\nwindow.createPost = async () =&gt; {\n    //get private key\n    const privateKey = createPrivateKey();\n    //get account name\n    const account = document.getElementById('username').value;\n    //for content\n    const time = new Date().getTime();\n    //get title\n    const title = `developers.steem.io - JS-T:17 ${time}`;\n    //get body\n    const body = `Go to [developers.steem.io](https://developers.steem.io) for the latest in Steem tutorials! This post was created by someone using the active version of those tutorials at  [https://github.com/steemit/devportal-tutorials-js](https://github.com/steemit/devportal-tutorials-js)\n        \n        ${time}`;\n    //get tags and convert to array list\n    const tags = 'blog';\n    const taglist = tags.split(' ');\n    //make simple json metadata including only tags\n    const json_metadata = JSON.stringify({ tags: taglist });\n    //generate random permanent link for post\n    const permlink = Math.random()\n        .toString(36)\n        .substring(2);\n\n    client.broadcast\n        .comment(\n            {\n                author: account,\n                body: body,\n                json_metadata: json_metadata,\n                parent_author: '',\n                parent_permlink: tags,\n                permlink: permlink,\n                title: title,\n            },\n            privateKey\n        )\n        .then(\n            function(result) {\n                document.getElementById('permlink').innerHTML = permlink;\n                document.getElementById(\n                    'postLink'\n                ).innerHTML = `Included in block: &lt;a href=\"http://condenser.steem.vc/${\n                    taglist[0]\n                }/@${account}/${permlink}\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;${\n                    result.block_num\n                }&lt;/a&gt;`;\n                document.getElementById('postResult').style.display = 'flex';\n                document.getElementById('permlink').value = permlink;\n            },\n            function(error) {\n                console.error(error);\n            }\n        );\n};\n\n\nYou may have noted the mystery function createPrivateKey(). It’s a convenience function that allows us to give the\nuser some meaningful UI feedback if they put in a bad posting key. The important part of it is\nreturn dsteem.PrivateKey.fromString(&lt;somestring&gt;) but its full glory can be seen in the snippet below\n\nconst createPrivateKey = function() {\n    try {\n        return dsteem.PrivateKey.fromString(\n            document.getElementById('postingKey').value\n        );\n    } catch (e) {\n        const resultEl = document.getElementById('result');\n        resultEl.className = 'form-control-plaintext alert alert-danger';\n        resultEl.innerHTML = e.message + ' - See console for full error.';\n        throw e;\n    }\n};\n\n\n3. Input variables\n\nThe required parameters for the vote operation is recorded via an HTML UI that can be found in the public/index.html file. The values are pre-populated in this case with a testnet demo account. The vote weight is input via a slider as this value can range between -10000 and 10000 denoting either a 100% flag or 100% upvote.\n\nThe parameter values are allocated as seen below, once the user clicks on the “Submit” button.\n\nwindow.submitVote = async () =&gt; {\n    //we'll make use of resultEl in multiple child scopes. This is generally good practice.\n    const resultEl = document.getElementById('result');\n    resultEl.innerHTML = 'pending...';\n\n    //get all values from the UI//\n    //get account name of voter\n    const voter = document.getElementById('username').value;\n    //get private posting key\n    const privateKey = createPrivateKey();\n    //get author of post/comment to vote\n    const author = document.getElementById('author').value;\n    //get post permalink to vote\n    const permlink = document.getElementById('permlink').value;\n    //get weight of vote\n    const weight = parseInt(\n        document.getElementById('currentWeight').innerHTML,\n        10\n    );\n    ....\n\n\nThe weight parameter is required to be an interger for the vote operation so we parse it from the UI text field. The permlink value is retrieved from the create post function.\n\n4. Broadcast\n\nWe create a vote object with the input variables before we can broadcast to the blockchain.\n\nconst vote = {\n    voter,\n    author,\n    permlink,\n    weight, //needs to be an integer for the vote function\n};\n\n\nAfter which we can complete the broadcast.vote operation with the created object and private posting key received from the input UI. The result of the vote is displayed on the UI to confirm whether it was a success or failed with details of that process being displayed on the console.\n\nclient.broadcast.vote(vote, privateKey).then(\n        function(result) {\n            console.log('success:', result);\n            resultEl.className = 'form-control-plaintext alert alert-success';\n            resultEl.innerHTML = 'Success! See console for full response.';\n        },\n        function(error) {\n            console.log('error:', error);\n            resultEl.className = 'form-control-plaintext alert alert-danger';\n            resultEl.innerHTML =\n                error.jse_shortmsg + ' - See console for full response.';\n        }\n    );\n\nwindow.onload = () =&gt; {\n    var voteWeightSlider = document.getElementById('voteWeight');\n    var currentWeightDiv = document.getElementById('currentWeight');\n    currentWeightDiv.innerHTML = voteWeightSlider.value;\n    voteWeightSlider.oninput = function() {\n        currentWeightDiv.innerHTML = this.value;\n    };\n\n\nMore information on how to use the broadcast operation and options surrounding the operation can be found on the Steem Devportal\n\nTo run this tutorial\n\n\n  clone this repo\n  cd tutorials/17_vote_on_content\n  npm i\n  npm run dev-server or npm run start\n  After a few moments, the server should be running at http://localhost:3000/"

A demo account is provided to use on the testnet but all variables can be easily changed and applied to the production server.\n\nThere is also an alternative method to vote for a witness using a hot signing link that can be generated via Steemconnect. You create a link using the witness name and the approve fields which denotes whether you want to vote for or remove the vote. This link then allows you to vote simply by signing in with your account details. This is a very simple way to send a vote request to any other user with the correct details already provided by the link.\n\nIntro\n\nWe are using the account witness vote function to create the vote which we then commit to the steem blockchain with a broadcast operation from dsteem. We also look at the vote status for a specific user using the getAccounts function. The parameters required for the witness voting operation are:\n\n\n  limit - Used in creating the witness list. Denotes the maximum number of witnesses to display\n  voter - This is the account making the vote\n  privatekey - The private active key of the voter account\n  witness - The name of the witness being voted for\n  approve - This is a boolean value determining whether the voting opration is to vote for, or to remove a vote\n\n\nSteps\n\n\n  Configure connection Configuration of dsteem to communicate with a Steem blockchain\n  Create witness list Displaying a list of active witnesses\n  Input variables Collecting the required inputs via an HTML UI\n  Voting status Confirming the current vote status for the selected witness\n  Broadcast Creating an object and broadcasting the vote to the blockchain\n\n\n1. Configure connection\n\nAs usual, we have a public/app.js file which holds the Javascript segment of the tutorial. In the first few lines we define the configured library and packages:\n\nimport { Client, PrivateKey } from 'dsteem';\nimport { Testnet as NetConfig } from '../../configuration'; //A Steem Testnet. Replace 'Testnet' with 'Mainnet' to connect to the main Steem blockchain.\n\nlet opts = { ...NetConfig.net };\n//connect to a steem node, testnet in this case\nconst client = new Client(NetConfig.url, opts);\n\n\nAbove, we have dsteem pointing to the test network with the proper chainId, addressPrefix, and endpoint by importing from the configuration.js file. Because this tutorial is interactive, we will not publish test content to the main network. Instead, we’re using the testnet and a predefined account which is imported once the application loads, to demonstrate witness voting.\n\nwindow.onload = async () =&gt; {\n    const account = NetConfig.accounts[0];\n    document.getElementById('username').value = account.address;\n    document.getElementById('activeKey').value = account.privActive;\n};\n\n\n2. Create witness list\n\nWe create a list of the current active witnesses available. This gives a list from which to select a witness to vote for. The list retrieved from the blockchain has a maximum length of 100 witnesses. We query the blockchain with the getState function and then use a for loop to display the list. This function is initiated once the user inputs a value for the limit variable and clicks on the “Fetch current Witnesses” button.\n\nwindow.createList = async () =&gt; {\n    //get list limit\n    const limit = document.getElementById('limit').value;\n\n    const witnessdata = await client.database.getState('witnesses');\n    var witnesses = [];\n\n    for (const witness in witnessdata.witnesses) {\n        console.log('witness', witness);\n        witnesses.push(\n            `&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"#\" onclick=\"document.getElementById('witness').value = '${witness}';\"&gt;${witness}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;`\n        );\n    }\n    console.log('witnesses', witnesses);\n    document.getElementById('witnessList').innerHTML = witnesses.join('');\n    document.getElementById('witnessListContainer').style.display = 'flex';\n};\n\n\n3. Input variables\n\nThe required parameters for the vote operation is recorded via an HTML UI that can be found in the public/index.html file. The values are pre-populated in this case with a testnet demo account.\n\nThe parameter values are allocated as seen below, once the user clicks on the “Submit Vote” button.\n\nwindow.submitVote = async () =&gt; {\n    //get all values from the UI\n    //get account name of voter\n    const voter = document.getElementById('username').value;\n    //get private active key\n    const privateKey = dsteem.PrivateKey.fromString(\n        document.getElementById('activeKey').value\n    );\n    //get witness name\n    const witness = document.getElementById('witness').value;\n\n\n4. Voting status\n\nThe approve parameter within the vote function determines whether the user is voting for the witness or removing its vote. In order to get the correct value for this parameter we first need to identify whether the user has already voted for the specified witness or not. One of the fields from the account information (blockchain query) holds an array of all the witnesses currently voted for by the user. The check returns true if the user has already voted for the selected witness. The result of this query is displayed and the user is given a choice whether to proceed with the vote/unvote process or stop the process activating a new function for each of those choices.\n\n    //check if witness is already voted for\n    _data = new Array\n    _data = await client.database.getAccounts([voter]);\n    const witnessvotes = _data[0][\"witness_votes\"];\n    const approve = witnessvotes.includes(witness);\n    if (approve) {\n        checkresult = \"Witness has already been voted for, would you like to remove vote?\"\n        votecheck = \"Vote removed\"\n    } else {\n        checkresult = \"Witness has not yet been voted for, would you like to vote?\"\n        votecheck = \"Vote added\"\n    }\n\n    document.getElementById('voteCheckContainer').style.display = 'flex';\n    document.getElementById('voteCheck').className = 'form-control-plaintext alert alert-success';\n    document.getElementById('voteCheck').innerHTML = checkresult;\n\n    document.getElementById(\"submitYesBtn\").style.visibility = \"visible\";\n    document.getElementById(\"submitNoBtn\").style.visibility = \"visible\";\n\n\n5. Broadcast\n\nWhen the user decides to continue with the voting process the actual vote function is triggered and we create a vote object with the input variables before we can broadcast to the blockchain.\n\nwindow.submitYes = async () =&gt; {\n        //create vote object\n        const vote = [\n        'account_witness_vote',\n        { account: voter, witness: witness, approve: !approve },\n        ];\n\n\nThe array cotains the function for the witness vote along with an object containing the needed parameters. We have to use the opposite of the approve variable that we created in the previous step. That variable is true if the user has already voted, and a value of true for the approve parameter means that the user is voting for the specified witness which will then return an error.\n\nAfter the object has been created we can broadcast the operation to the steem blockchain along with the private active key of the user. The result of the vote is displayed on the UI to confirm whether you voted for or removed a vote for the witness as well as error details should there be one.\n\n//broadcast the vote\nclient.broadcast.sendOperations([vote], privateKey).then(\n    function(result) {\n        console.log(\n            'included in block: ' + result.block_num,\n            'expired: ' + result.expired\n        );\n        document.getElementById('voteCheckContainer').style.display = 'flex';\n        document.getElementById('voteCheck').className =\n            'form-control-plaintext alert alert-success';\n        document.getElementById('voteCheck').innerHTML = votecheck;\n    },\n    function(error) {\n        console.error(error);\n        document.getElementById('voteCheckContainer').style.display = 'flex';\n        document.getElementById('voteCheck').className =\n            'form-control-plaintext alert alert-danger';\n        document.getElementById('voteCheck').innerHTML = error.jse_shortmsg;\n    }\n);\ndocument.getElementById('submitYesBtn').style.visibility = 'hidden';\ndocument.getElementById('submitNoBtn').style.visibility = 'hidden';\n\n\nShould the user choose to stop the process the following function is executed.\n\nwindow.submitNo = async () =&gt; {\n    document.getElementById('voteCheckContainer').style.display = 'flex';\n    document.getElementById('voteCheck').className =\n        'form-control-plaintext alert alert-success';\n    document.getElementById('voteCheck').innerHTML =\n        'Vote process has ben cancelled';\n    document.getElementById('submitYesBtn').style.visibility = 'hidden';\n    document.getElementById('submitNoBtn').style.visibility = 'hidden';\n};\n\n\nThe option buttons (continue with voting process or stop) are disabled at the end of the process in order to remove confusion on what to do next or what the option buttons will do.\n\nTo run this tutorial\n\n\n  clone this repo\n  cd tutorials/22_witness_listing_and_voting\n  npm i\n  npm run dev-server or npm run start\n  After a few moments, the server should be running at http://localhost:3000/"

  			 				"type": "",
  							"url": "/tutorials-python/account_recovery",
  							"content": "Full, runnable src of Account Recovery can be downloaded as part of the PY tutorials repository.\n\n\nIn this tutorial we show you how to request account recovery for a user and also recover that account on the Steem blockchain using the beem-python library.\n\nThe recovery system is used to recover hacked accounts. In the event that you lose your password, your account is lost forever. You must know at least one old password that was used on your account within 30 days. This recovery process can only be executed once an hour. Stolen Account Recovery gives the rightful account owner 30 days to recover their account from the moment the thief changed their owner key.\n\nIntro\n\nThere are two parties involved in recovering an account. The user that requires their account to be recovered, and the recovery account (or trustee) which is the account that created the username on the blockchain. For anyone creating their account through the main Steemit webiste, their recovery account would be Steemit. If however your account was created for you by another user, that user is the one that would have to initialize your account recovery. The recovery account can be changed however to whichever user you require.\n\nFor this tutorial we are using the beem-python library which contains the required functions to execute this recovery process. There are two main sections to this process. Firstly, there is the request_account_recovery function where the owner is verified and the intent for account recovery is transmitted to the blockchain. The second part is the actual recover_account process. Along with this we also create a complete set of new account keys (posting, active, owner and memo) in order for the account to function properly. If these keys are not generated you will receive an error when trying to log in with your new password: This password is bound to your account's owner key and can not be used to login to this site. However, you can use it to update your password to obtain a more secure set of keys\n\nThis tutorial runs on the live network so special care needs to be taken when running it.\n\nThe request_account_recovery function has the following parameters:\n\n\n  account to recover - The account name that wishes to be recovered\n  recovery account - The trustee account / account owner that will recover the account\n  new owner authority - The new owner PUBLIC key of the account to be recovered\n  extensions - empty array\n\n\nThe recover_account function has the following parameters:\n\n\n  account_to_recover - The account name that wishes to be recovered\n  new_owner_authority - The new owner PUBLIC key of the account to be recovered\n  recent_owner_authority - The OLD owner PUBLIC key of the account to be recovered\n  extensions - empty array\n\n\nSteps\n\n\n  App setup - Library install and import. Input user info and connection to production\n  Owner key creation - Creation of new and old owner keys\n  Recovery request operation and transmission - creation of data object, operation and transmission of recovery request function\n  Account recovery and new account keys data objects - creation of new account keys and objects for account update and recovery\n  Account recovery commit - transmit account recovery to blockchain\n  Account update commit - transmit account key update to blockchain\n\n\n1. App setup and connection \n\nIn this tutorial we use 1 packages:\n\n\n  beem - beem-python library and interaction with Blockchain\n\n\nWe import the libraries for the application.\n\nimport beembase\nfrom beem.account import Account\nfrom beem import Steem\nfrom beem.transactionbuilder import TransactionBuilder\nfrom beemgraphenebase.account import PasswordKey\nfrom beembase.objects import Permission\n\n\nThere are 5 inputs required. The account name to be recovered along with the old and new passwords. We also require the account name and private active key of the recovery account (account owner / trustee). For the first step in the process we initialize the steem class with the private key from the recovery account. The values are supplied via the terminal/console.\n\n#capture user information\nusername = input('account to be recovered: ')\nold_password = input('recent password for account: ')\nnew_password = input('new password for account: ')\n\nrecovery_account = input('account owner (recovery account): ')\nrecovery_account_private_key = input('account owner private ACTIVE key: ')\n\n#connect to production server with active key\ns = Steem(node=['https://api.steemit.com'], keys=[recovery_account_private_key])\n\n\nThe new password for the account to be recovered must be at least 32 characters long.\n\n2. Owner key creation \n\nBoth new and old owner keys are generated from the passwords supplied in the first step. For a more in depth look at creating keys please refer to this tutorial on changing your password and keys.\n\n#create new account owner keys\nnew_account_owner_private_key = PasswordKey(username, new_password, role='owner').get_private_key()\nnew_account_owner_private_key_string = str(new_account_owner_private_key)\nnew_account_owner_public_key = str(new_account_owner_private_key.pubkey)\n\n#create old account owner keys\nold_account_owner_private_key = PasswordKey(username, old_password, role='owner').get_private_key()\nold_account_owner_private_key_string = str(old_account_owner_private_key)\nold_account_owner_public_key = str(old_account_owner_private_key.pubkey)\n\n\nThe Steem blockchain knows the history of your account, and every owner key that has ever been used for it. When you enter your recent password, it uses that to generate an owner key that can match up to a previous owner public key on the account. Without that password and owner key, the recovery account can’t do anything to recover your account.\n\n3. Recovery request operation and transmission \n\nThe new_owner_authority containing the new public key is formatted in order to be used in the request_account_recovery operation. Once the data object has been created, the operation is transmitted to the blockchain to confirm that the account in question is going to be recovered.\n\nnew_owner_authority = {\n    \"key_auths\": [\n        [new_account_owner_public_key, 1]\n    ],\n    \"account_auths\": [],\n    \"weight_threshold\": 1\n}\n\n#recovery request data object creation\nrequest_op_data = {\n    'account_to_recover': username,\n    'recovery_account': recovery_account,\n    'new_owner_authority': new_owner_authority,\n    'extensions': []\n}\n\n#recovery request operation creation\nrequest_op = beembase.operations.Request_account_recovery(**request_op_data)\n\nprint('request_op_data')\nprint(request_op_data)\n\n#recovery request broadcast\nrequest_result = s.finalizeOp(request_op, recovery_account, \"active\")\n\nprint('request_result')\nprint(request_result)\n\n\n4. Account recovery and new account keys data objects \n\nThe old owner key is formatted and the object for the account recovery function is created with the required parameters.\n\nrecent_owner_authority = {\n    \"key_auths\": [\n        [old_account_owner_public_key, 1]\n    ],\n    \"account_auths\": [],\n    \"weight_threshold\": 1\n}\n\nop_recover_account_data = {\n    'account_to_recover': username,\n    'new_owner_authority': new_owner_authority,\n    'recent_owner_authority': recent_owner_authority,\n    'extensions': []\n}\n\n\nThe object for the account key update operation is created with the relevant keys created in the correct format within the object.\n\nop_account_update_data = {\n    \"account\": username,\n    \"active\": {\n        \"key_auths\": [\n            [str(PasswordKey(username, new_password, role='active').get_private_key().pubkey), 1]\n        ],\n        \"account_auths\": [],\n        \"weight_threshold\": 1\n    },\n    \"posting\": {\n        \"key_auths\": [\n            [str(PasswordKey(username, new_password, role='posting').get_private_key().pubkey), 1]\n        ],\n        \"account_auths\": [],\n        \"weight_threshold\": 1\n    },\n    \"memo_key\": str(PasswordKey(username, new_password, role='memo').get_private_key().pubkey),\n    \"json_metadata\": \"\"\n}\n\n\n5. Account recovery commit \n\nThe steem class is initialised once more but with the required WIF for this specific section. This is necessary when different keys are required at various steps. The recover_account function is transmitted to the blockchain via the TransactionBuilder operation in order to append the new private keys. The operation is then broadcast.\n\ns = Steem(node=['https://api.steemit.com'], keys=[recovery_account_private_key])\n\nop_recover_account = beembase.operations.Recover_account(**op_recover_account_data)\n\nprint('op_recover_account')\nprint(op_recover_account)\n\ntb = TransactionBuilder()\ntb.appendOps([op_recover_account])\ntb.appendWif(str(old_account_owner_private_key))\ntb.appendWif(str(new_account_owner_private_key))\ntb.sign()\n\nresult = tb.broadcast()\nprint('result')\nprint(result)\n\n\n6. Account update commit \n\nThe same basic process is followed as in the previous step. For this step however we require the new owner private key which is initialised in the steem class. The TransactionBuilder operation is used once more for the transmission to the blockchain.\n\ns = Steem(node=['https://api.steemit.com'], keys=[new_account_owner_private_key])\n\nop_account_update = beembase.operations.Account_update(**op_account_update_data)\n\nprint('op_account_update')\nprint(op_account_update)\n\ntb = TransactionBuilder()\ntb.appendOps([op_account_update])\ntb.appendWif(str(new_account_owner_private_key))\ntb.sign()\n\nresult = tb.broadcast()\n\nprint('result')\nprint(result)\n\n\nAnd that’s it!\n\nTo Run the tutorial\n\n\n  review dev requirements\n  clone this repo\n  cd tutorials/35_account_recovery\n  pip install -r requirements.txt\n  python index.py\n  After a few moments, you should see a prompt for input in terminal screen."

We will define that function in this tutorial and show how to fetch and interpret reputation.\n\nSteps\n\n\n  App setup - Library install and import\n  Account list - List of predefined accouns to select from\n  Reputation interpret - Reputation converting function\n  Print output - Print results in output\n\n\n1. App setup \n\nIn this tutorial we will use 4 packages, pick - helps us to select filter interactively. steem - steem-python library, interaction with Blockchain. pprint - print results in better format and math to perform some math calculations.\n\nFirst we import all libraries and initialize Steem class\n\n    import pprint\n    import math\n    from pick import pick\n\n    # initialize Steem class\n    from steem import Steem\n\n    s = Steem()\n\n\n2. Account list \n\nNext we will show predefined account list to select and setup pick properly.\n\n    title = 'Please choose account: '\n    options = [\"steemitblog\",\"esteemapp\",\"busy.org\",\"demo\"]\n\n    # get index and selected filter name\n    option, index = pick(options, title)\n\n    # option is printed as reference\n    pprint.pprint(\"Selected: \"+option)\n\n\nThis will show us list of accounts to select in terminal/command prompt. And after selection we will fetch account details from Blockchain with get_accounts function.\n\n    user = s.get_accounts([option])\n\n\n3. Reputation interpret \n\nNext we will define reputation interpreter:\n\ndef rep_log10(rep):\n    \"\"\"Convert raw steemd rep into a UI-ready value centered at 25.\"\"\"\n    def log10(string):\n        leading_digits = int(string[0:4])\n        log = math.log10(leading_digits) + 0.00000001\n        num = len(string) - 1\n        return num + (log - int(log))\n\n    rep = str(rep)\n    if rep == \"0\":\n        return 25\n\n    sign = -1 if rep[0] == '-' else 1\n    if sign &lt; 0:\n        rep = rep[1:]\n\n    out = log10(rep)\n    out = max(out - 9, 0) * sign  # @ -9, $1 earned is approx magnitude 1\n    out = (out * 9) + 25          # 9 points per magnitude. center at 25\n    return round(out, 2)\n\n\nAbove function will cover all edge cases, for example, if account is new their reputation is 0 hence, default starting reputation will be 25. If reputation negative that’s also considered.\n\n4. Print output \n\nAfter we have fetched account details from Blockchain, all we have to do is to use defined function above to interpret account’s reputation field into meaningful number.\n\n    # print specified account's reputation\n    pprint.pprint(rep_log10(user[0]['reputation']))\n\n\nThat’s it. We have successfully interpreted reputation.\n\nTo Run the tutorial\n\n\n  review dev requirements\n  clone this repo\n  cd tutorials/20_account_reputation\n  pip install -r requirements.txt\n  python index.py\n  After a few moments, you should see output in terminal/command prompt screen."

  							"content": "Full, runnable src of Claim Rewards can be downloaded as part of the PY tutorials repository.\n\n\nIn this tutorial we show you how to check the STEEM, SBD and STEEM POWER rewards balances of an account on the Steem blockchain, and how to claim either a portion or all of the rewards for an account using the commit class found within the steem-python library.\n\nIntro\n\nThe Steem python library has a built-in function to transmit transactions to the blockchain. We are using the claim_reward_balance method found within the commit class in the library. Before we transmit a claim, we use the get_account function to check the current rewards balance of the account to see what is available to claim. The claim method has 4 parameters:\n\n\n  reward steem - The amount of STEEM to claim\n  reward sbd - The amount of SBD to claim\n  reward vests - The amount of VESTS (STEEM POWER) to claim\n  account - The source account for the claim\n\n\nSteps\n\n\n  App setup - Library install and import. Connection to testnet\n  User information and steem node - Input user information and connection to Steem node\n  Check reward balance - Check current rewards balances of user account\n  Claim commit - Input amount of rewards to claim and commit to blockchain\n  Balance update - Check new rewards balances after completed claim\n\n\n1. App setup \n\nIn this tutorial we use 2 packages:\n\n\n  steem - steem-python library and interaction with Blockchain\n  pick - helps select the query type interactively\n\n\nWe import the libraries and connect to the testnet.\n\nimport steembase\nimport steem\nfrom pick import pick\nfrom steem.amount import Amount\n\nsteembase.chains.known_chains['STEEM'] = {\n    'chain_id': '79276aea5d4877d9a25892eaa01b0adf019d3e5cb12a97478df3298ccdd01673',\n    'prefix': 'STX', 'steem_symbol': 'STEEM', 'sbd_symbol': 'SBD', 'vests_symbol': 'VESTS'\n}\n\n\nBecause this tutorial alters the blockchain we connect to a testnet so we don’t create spam on the production server.\n\n2. User information and steem node \n\nWe require the private active key of the user in order for the claim to be committed to the blockchain. This is why we are using a testnet. The values are supplied via the terminal/console before we initialise the steem class. There are some demo accounts available but we encourage you to create your own accounts on this testnet and create balances you can claim; it’s good practice.\n\n#capture user information\nusername = input('Enter username: ') #demo account: cdemo\nwif = input('Enter private ACTIVE key: ') #demo account: 5KaNM84WWSqzwKzY82fXPaUW43idbLnPqf5SfjGxLfw6eV2kAP3\n\n#connect node\nclient = steem.Steem(nodes=['https://testnet.steem.vc'],keys=[wif])\n\n\n3. Check reward balance \n\nWe send a query to the blockchain using the get_account function to check if the username exists on the blockchain. We also use this function to get a clear picture of the available rewards that can be claimed and display this on the console/terminal.\n\n#get account reward balances\nuserinfo = client.get_account(username)\n\nif(userinfo is None) :\n    print('Oops. Looks like user ' + username + ' doesn\\'t exist on this chain!')\n    exit()\n\nreward_steem = userinfo['reward_steem_balance']\nreward_sbd = userinfo['reward_sbd_balance']\nreward_sp = userinfo['reward_vesting_steem']\nreward_vests = userinfo['reward_vesting_balance']\n\nprint('Reward Balances:' + '\\n' + \n    'STEEM: ' + reward_steem + '\\n' + \n    'SBD: ' + reward_sbd + '\\n' + \n    'STEEM POWER: ' + reward_sp + '\\n' +\n    'VESTS: ' + reward_vests\n    )\n\ninput('\\n' + 'Press enter to continue to claim selection')\n\n\n4. Claim commit \n\nAn option is provided to either claim all rewards at once or to specify specific amounts to be claimed for each individual reward balance. If you are using one of Steemit’s demo accounts, please leave some rewards for others to claim!\n\n#choice of claim\ntitle = 'Please choose claim type: '\noptions = ['ALL', 'SELECTED', 'CANCEL']\noption, index = pick(options, title)\n\n\nWhen the option to claim all rewards is selected, the claim parameters are automatically assigned from the get_accounts query. We also check that there are in fact outstanding rewards balances before we commit the claim.\n\n#commit claim based on selection\nif option == 'ALL':\n    if Amount(reward_steem).amount + Amount(reward_sbd).amount + Amount(reward_vests).amount == 0:\n        print('\\n' + 'No rewards to claim')\n        exit()\n    else:\n        client.claim_reward_balance(reward_steem, reward_sbd, reward_vests, username)\n        print('\\n' + 'All reward balances have been claimed. New reward balances are:' + '\\n')\nelse:\n    if option == 'CANCEL':\n        print('\\n' + 'Operation cancelled')\n        exit()\n    else:\n        claim_steem = input('\\n' + 'Please enter the amount of STEEM to claim: ') + ' STEEM'\n        claim_sbd = input('Please enter the amount of SBD to claim: ') + ' SBD'\n        claim_vests = input('Please enter the amount of VESTS to claim: ') + ' VESTS'\n        if Amount(claim_steem).amount + Amount(claim_sbd).amount + Amount(claim_vests).amount == 0:\n            print('\\n' + 'Zero values entered, no claim to submit')\n            exit()\n        else:\n            if claim_steem &gt; reward_steem or claim_sbd &gt; reward_sbd or claim_vests &gt; reward_vests:\n                print('\\n' + 'Requested claim value higher than available rewards')\n                exit()\n            else:\n                client.claim_reward_balance(claim_steem, claim_sbd, claim_vests, username)\n                print('\\n' + 'Claim has been processed. New reward balances are:' + '\\n')\n\n\n\nWhen doing only a selected claim of available rewards, the values are captured in the console/terminal. The inputs cannot be negative, must be less than or equal to the available reward and at least ONE of the inputs needs to be greater than zero for the claim to be able to transmit. The result of the selected option is printed on the UI.\n\n5. Balance update \n\nAs a final check we run the account query again to get updated values for the available rewards balances.\n\n#get updated account reward balances\ninput(\"Press enter for new account balances\")\n\nuserinfo = client.get_account(username)\n\nreward_steem = userinfo['reward_steem_balance']\nreward_sbd = userinfo['reward_sbd_balance']\nreward_sp = userinfo['reward_vesting_steem']\nreward_vests = userinfo['reward_vesting_balance']\n\nprint('STEEM: ' + reward_steem + '\\n' + \n    'SBD: ' + reward_sbd + '\\n' + \n    'STEEM POWER: ' + reward_sp + '\\n' +\n    'VESTS: ' + reward_vests\n    )\n\n\nWe encourage users to play around with different values and data types to fully understand how this process works. You can also check the balances and transaction history on the testnet portal.\n\nTo Run the tutorial\n\n\n  review dev requirements\n  clone this repo\n  cd tutorials/23_claim_rewards\n  pip install -r requirements.txt\n  python index.py\n  After a few moments, you should see a prompt for input in terminal screen."

It is also not possible to stop a conversion once initialised. During the 3.5 days for it to be converted and as the conversion price fluctuates you could actually be receiving less STEEM than what you should. Because of this, the method in this tutorial is NOT the preferred or most efficient way of converting SBD to STEEM. This tutorial just illustrates that it can be done in this manner.\n\nThere is a marketplace on Steemit that allows you to “sell” your SBD instantly. With this process you can get your STEEM immediately and at the exact price that you expect. The market place is the better way to convert your SBD. This article provides more information on using the market to exchange your SBD to STEEM\n\nSteemconnect offers an alternative to converting SBD with a “simple link” solution. Instead of running through a list of operations on your account, you can simply use a link similar to the one below substituting the three parameters for your own details. You will be prompted to enter your username and password before the transaction will be executed.\nhttps://steemconnect.com/sign/convert?owner=username&amp;requestid=1234567&amp;amount=0.000%20SBD\nThis is similar to the steemconnect links that have been covered in previous tutorials. For a list of signing operations that work in this manner you can go to https://v2.steemconnect.com/sign\nThis article has more information on using steemconnect\n\nIntro\n\nThe Steem python library has a built-in function to transmit transactions to the blockchain. We are using the convert method found within the commit class in the library. Before we do the conversion, we check the current balance of the account to check how much SBD is available. This is not strictly necessary as the process will automatically abort with the corresponding error, but it does give some insight into the process as a whole. We use the get_account function to check for this. The convert method has 3 parameters:\n\n\n  amount - The amount of SBD that will be converted\n  account - The specified user account for the conversion\n  request-id - An identifier for tracking the conversion. This parameter is optional\n\n\nSteps\n\n\n  App setup - Library install and import. Connection to testnet\n  User information and steem node - Input user information and connection to Steem node\n  Check balance - Check current STEEM and SBD balance of user account\n  Conversion amount and commit - Input of SBD amount to convert and commit to blockchain\n\n\n1. App setup \n\nIn this tutorial we only use 1 package:\n\n\n  steem - steem-python library and interaction with Blockchain\n\n\nWe import the libraries and connect to the testnet.\n\nimport steembase\nimport steem\n\nsteembase.chains.known_chains['STEEM'] = {\n    'chain_id': '79276aea5d4877d9a25892eaa01b0adf019d3e5cb12a97478df3298ccdd01673',\n    'prefix': 'STX', 'steem_symbol': 'STEEM', 'sbd_symbol': 'SBD', 'vests_symbol': 'VESTS'\n}\n\n\nBecause this tutorial alters the blockchain we connect to the testnet so we don’t create spam on the production server.\n\n2. User information and steem node \n\nWe require the private active key of the user in order for the conversion to be committed to the blockchain. This is why we have to specify this alongside the testnet node. The values are supplied via the terminal/console before we initialise the steem class. There is a demo account available to use with this tutorial but any account that is set up on the testnet can be used.\n\n#capture user information\nusername = input('Enter username: ') #demo account: demo01\nwif = input('Enter private ACTIVE key: ') #demo account: 5HxTntgeoLm4trnTz94YBsY6MpAap1qRVXEKsU5n1v2du1gAgVH\n\n#connect node and private active key\nclient = steem.Steem(nodes=['https://testnet.steem.vc'], keys=[wif])\n\n\n3. Check balance \n\nIn order to give the user enough information to make the conversion we check the current balance of the account using the get_account function.\n\n#get account balance for STEEM and SBD\nuserinfo = client.get_account(username)\ntotal_steem = userinfo['balance']\ntotal_sbd = userinfo['sbd_balance']\n\nprint('CURRENT ACCOUNT BALANCE:' + '\\n' + total_steem + '\\n' + total_sbd + '\\n')\n\n\nThe result of the query is displayed in the console/terminal.\n\n4. Conversion amount and commit \n\nThe final step before we can commit the transaction to the blockchain is to assign the amount parameter. We do this via a simple input from the terminal/console.\n\n#get recipient name\nconvert_amount = input('Enter the amount of SBD to convert to STEEM: ')\n\n\nThis value must be greater than zero in order for the transaction to execute without any errors. Now that we have all the parameters we can do the actual transmission of the transaction to the blockchain.\n\n#parameters: amount, account, request_id\nclient.convert(float(convert_amount), username)\n\nprint('\\n' + convert_amount + ' SBD has been converted to STEEM')\n\n\nIf no errors are encountered a simple confirmation is printed on the UI.\n\nAs an added confirmation we check the balance of the user again and display it on the UI. This is not required at all but it serves as a more definitive confirmation that the conversion has been completed correctly.\n\n#get remaining account balance for STEEM and SBD\nuserinfo = client.get_account(username)\ntotal_steem = userinfo['balance']\ntotal_sbd = userinfo['sbd_balance']\n\nprint('\\n' + 'REMAINING ACCOUNT BALANCE:' + '\\n' + total_steem + '\\n' + total_sbd)\n\n\nThe STEEM balance will not yet have been updated as it takes 3.5 days to settle. The SBD will however show the new balance.\n\nWe encourage users to play around with different values and data types to fully understand how this process works. You can also check the balances and transaction history on the testnet portal.\n\nTo Run the tutorial\n\n\n  review dev requirements\n  clone this repo\n  cd tutorials/32_convert_sbd_to_steem\n  pip install -r requirements.txt\n  python index.py\n  After a few moments, you should see a prompt for input in terminal screen."

App setup \n\nIn this tutorial we use 3 packages:\n\n\n  steem - steem-python library and interaction with Blockchain\n  pick - helps select the query type interactively\n  pprint - print results in better format\n\n\nWe import the libraries and connect to the testnet.\n\nimport steembase\nimport steem\nfrom pick import pick\nimport pprint\nfrom steem.amount import Amount\n\nsteembase.chains.known_chains['STEEM'] = {\n    'chain_id': '79276aea5d4877d9a25892eaa01b0adf019d3e5cb12a97478df3298ccdd01673',\n    'prefix': 'STX', 'steem_symbol': 'STEEM', 'sbd_symbol': 'SBD', 'vests_symbol': 'VESTS'\n}\n\n\nBecause this tutorial alters the blockchain we connect to a testnet so we don’t create spam on the production server.\n\n2. User information and steem node \n\nWe require the private active key of the user in order for the transaction to be committed to the blockchain. This is why we are using a testnet. The values are supplied via the terminal/console before we initialise the steem class. We also check if the user name provided is active on the chain. There are some demo accounts available but we encourage you to create your own accounts on this testnet and create balances you can delegate.\n\n#capture user information\nusername = input('Enter username: ') #demo account: cdemo\nwif = input('Enter private ACTIVE key: ') #demo account: 5KaNM84WWSqzwKzY82fXPaUW43idbLnPqf5SfjGxLfw6eV2kAP3\n\n#connect node and private active key\nclient = steem.Steem(nodes=['https://testnet.steem.vc'], keys=[wif])\n\n#check valid user\nuserinfo = client.get_account(username)\nif(userinfo is None) :\n    print('Oops. Looks like user ' + username + ' doesn\\'t exist on this chain!')\n    exit()\n\n\n3. Check balance \n\nIn order to give the user enough information to make the delegation we check the current VESTS balance of the account using the get_account function. We also display a list of currently active delegations should the user choose to remove a delegation. You can refer to tutorial 29_get_delegations_by_user to see how this is done.\n\n#display active delegations (refer to tutorial #29_get_delegations_by_user)\ndelegations = client.get_vesting_delegations(username, '', 100)\nif len(delegations) == 0:\n\tprint('No active delegations')\nelse:\n\tpprint.pprint(delegations)\n\n#available VESTS\navail_vests = (Amount(userinfo['vesting_shares']).amount - \n    ((userinfo['to_withdraw']-userinfo['withdrawn'])/1000000)-\n    Amount(userinfo['delegated_vesting_shares']).amount)\nprint('\\n' + 'Available VESTS : ' + str(avail_vests))\n\ninput('Press enter to continue' + '\\n')\n\n\nThe result of the query is displayed in the console/terminal.\n\n4. Delegation amount and commit \n\nBoth the vesting_shares and the to_account parameters are assigned via input from the terminal/console. The user is given the option to delegate power to or remove a currently active delegation from another user. We also check the to_account to make sure it’s a valid account name.\n\n#choice of action\ntitle = ('Please choose action')\noptions = ['DELEGATE POWER', 'UN-DELEGATE POWER', 'CANCEL']\noption, index = pick(options, title)\n\nif (option == 'CANCEL') :\n    print('operation cancelled')\n    exit()\n\n#get account to authorise and check if valid\ndelegatee = input('Please enter the account name to ADD / REMOVE delegation: ')\ndelegatee_userinfo = client.get_account(delegatee)\nif(delegatee_userinfo is None) :\n    print('Oops. Looks like user ' + delegatee + ' doesn\\'t exist on this chain!')\n    exit()\n\n\nAny amount of VESTS delegated to a user will overwrite the amount of VESTS currently delegated to that user. This means that to cancel a delegation we transmit to the blockchain a vesting_shares value of zero. The inputs and function execution is based on the users choice. If you are using one of Steemit’s demo accounts, please leave some VESTS for others to delegate!\n\nif (option == 'DELEGATE POWER') :\n    vesting_value = input('Please enter the amount of VESTS to delegate: ')\n    vesting_shares = (str(vesting_value) + ' VESTS')\n    client.delegate_vesting_shares(to_account=delegatee, vesting_shares=vesting_shares, account=username)\n    print('\\n' + str(vesting_shares) + ' have been successfully been delegated to ' + delegatee)\nelse :\n    vesting_shares = '0 VESTS'\n    client.delegate_vesting_shares(to_account=delegatee, vesting_shares=vesting_shares, account=username)\n    print('Delegated VESTS have been successfully removed from ' + delegatee)\n\n\nA confirmation of the transaction is displayed on the UI.\n\nWe encourage users to play around with different values and data types to fully understand how this process works. You can also check the balances and transaction history on the testnet portal.\n\nTo Run the tutorial\n\n\n  review dev requirements\n  clone this repo\n  cd tutorials/27_delegate_power\n  pip install -r requirements.txt\n  python index.py\n  After a few moments, you should see a prompt for input in terminal screen."

The Steem python library has a built-in function to transmit transactions to the blockchain. We are using the diff_match_patch class for python to create a patch for a post or comment. We then use the post method found within the commit class in the library. It should be noted that comments and new post are both treated as commit.post operation with the only difference being that a comment/reply has got an additional parameter containing the parent post/comment. There is already a tutorial on how to create a new post so the focus of this tutorial will be on patching the content of the post. We will be using a couple of methods within the diff_match_patch class.\n\ndiff_main - This compares two text fields to find the differences.\ndiff_cleanupSemantic - This reduces the number of edits by eliminating semantically trivial equalities.\ndiff_levenshtein - Computes the Levenshtein distance: the number of inserted, deleted or substituted characters\npatch_make - Creates a patch based on the calculated differences. This method can be executed in 3 different ways based on the parameters. By using the two separate text fields in question, by using only the calculated difference, or by using the original text along with the calculated difference.\npatch_apply - This applies the created patch to the original text field.\n\nSteps\n\n\n  App setup - Library install and import. Connection to testnet\n  User information and steem node - Input user information and connection to Steem node\n  Post to update - Input and retrieve post information\n  Patching - Create the patch to update the post\n  New post commit - Commit the post to the blockchain\n\n\n1. App setup \n\nIn this tutorial we use 2 packages:\n\n\n  steem - steem-python library and interaction with Blockchain\n  diff_match_patch - used to compute the difference between two text fields to create a patch\n\n\nWe import the libraries and connect to the testnet.\n\nimport steembase\nimport steem\nfrom diff_match_patch import diff_match_patch\n\nsteembase.chains.known_chains['STEEM'] = {\n    'chain_id': '79276aea5d4877d9a25892eaa01b0adf019d3e5cb12a97478df3298ccdd01673',\n    'prefix': 'STX', 'steem_symbol': 'STEEM', 'sbd_symbol': 'SBD', 'vests_symbol': 'VESTS'\n}\n\n\nBecause this tutorial alters the blockchain we connect to a testnet so we don’t create spam on the production server.\n\n2. User information and steem node \n\nWe require the private posting key of the user in order for the transfer to be committed to the blockchain. This is why we are using a testnet. The values are supplied via the terminal/console before we initialise the steem class. There are some demo accounts available but we encourage you to create your own accounts on this testnet and create balances you can claim; it’s good practice.\n\n#capture user information\nusername = input('Enter username: ') #demo account: cdemo\nwif = input('Enter private POSTING key: ') #demo account: 5JEZ1EiUjFKfsKP32b15Y7jybjvHQPhnvCYZ9BW62H1LDUnMvHz\n\n#connect node and private active key\nclient = steem.Steem(nodes=['https://testnet.steem.vc'], keys=[wif])\n\n\n3. Post to update \n\nThe user inputs the author and permlink of the post that they wish to edit. It should be noted that a post cannot be patched once it has been archived. We suggest referring to the submit post tutorial to create a new post before trying the patch process.\n\n#check valid username\nuserinfo = client.get_account(username)\nif(userinfo is None) :\n    print('Oops. Looks like user ' + username + ' doesn\\'t exist on this chain!')\n    exit()\n\npost_author = input('Please enter the AUTHOR of the post you want to edit: ')\npost_permlink = input('Please enter the PERMLINK of the post you want to edit: ')\n\n#get details of selected post\ndetails = client.get_content(post_author, post_permlink)\n\nprint('\\n' + 'Title: ' + details['title'])\no_body = details['body']\nprint('Body:' + '\\n' + o_body + '\\n')\n\nn_body = input('Please enter new post content:' + '\\n')\n\n\nThe user also inputs the updated text in the console/terminal. This will then give us the two text fields to compare.\n\n4. Patching \n\nThe module is initiated and the new post text is checked for validity.\n\n#initialise the diff match patch module\ndmp = diff_match_patch()\n\n#Check for null input\nif (n_body == '') :\n    print('\\n' + 'No new post body supplied. Operation aborted')\n    exit()\nelse :\n    # Check for equality\n    if (o_body == n_body) :\n        print('\\n' + 'No changes made to post body. Operation aborted')\n        exit()\n\n\nThe diff is calculated and a test is done to check the diff length against the total length of the new text to determine if it will be better to patch or just replace the text field. The value to be sent to the blockchain is then assigned to the new_body parameter.\n\n#check for differences in the text field\ndiff = dmp.diff_main(o_body, n_body)\n#Reduce the number of edits by eliminating semantically trivial equalities.\ndmp.diff_cleanupSemantic(diff)\n#check patch length\nif (dmp.diff_levenshtein(diff) &lt; len(o_body)) :\n    #create patch\n    patch = dmp.patch_make(o_body, diff)\n    #create new text based on patch\n    patch_body = dmp.patch_apply(patch, o_body)\n    new_body = patch_body[0]\nelse :\n    new_body = n_body\n\n\n5. New post commit \n\nThe only new parameter is the changed body text. All the other parameters to do a commit is assigned directly from the original post entered by the user.\n\n#commit post to blockchain with all old values and new body text\nclient.commit.post(title=details['title'], body=new_body, author=details['author'], permlink=details['permlink'],\n    json_metadata=details['json_metadata'], reply_identifier=(details['parent_author'] + '/' + details['parent_permlink']))\n\nprint('\\n' + 'Content of the post has been successfully updated')\n\n\nA simple confirmation is displayed on the screen for a successful commit.\n\nWe encourage users to play around with different values and data types to fully understand how this process works. You can also check the balances and transaction history on the testnet portal.\n\nTo Run the tutorial\n\n\n  review dev requirements\n  clone this repo\n  cd tutorials/12_edit_content_patching\n  pip install -r requirements.txt\n  python index.py\n  After a few moments, you should see a prompt for input in terminal screen."

We are using the follow and unfollow methods found within the commit class in the the library. Before we can follow/unfollow we first have to check what the current ‘follow status’ is of the author. We use another function for this which is explained in the tutorial entitled get_following_and_follower_list. There are 3 parameters within the follow/unfollow methods:\n\n\n  follow/unfollow - The name of the author that will be followed/unfollowed\n  what - The list of states to be followed. Currently this defaults to blog as it’s the only option available on the block chain at this stage\n  account - The name of the account that is executing the follow/unfollow\n\n\nSteps\n\n\n  App setup - Library install and import. Connection to testnet\n  User information and steem node - Input user information and connection to Steem node\n  Check author status - Validity check on requested autor to follow\n  Follow status - Check whether specified author is already followed\n  Follow/Unfollow commit - Follow/unfollow commit to the blockchain\n\n\n1.

User information and steem node\n\nWe also require the private posting key of the user that wishes to follow a selected author in order to commit the action to the blockchain. This is why we have to specify this along with the testnet node. The values are supplied via the terminal/console before we initialise the steem class. We have supplied a test account, cdemo to use with this tutorial but any demo account set up on the testnet can be used.\n\n#capture user information\nusername = input('Please enter your username: ')\npostingkey = input('Please enter your private posting key: ')\n\n#connect node and private posting key, demo account being used: cdemo, posting key: 5JEZ1EiUjFKfsKP32b15Y7jybjvHQPhnvCYZ9BW62H1LDUnMvHz\ns = steem.Steem(nodes=['https://testnet.steem.vc'], keys=[postingkey])\n\n\n3. Check author status\n\nTo insure the validity of the follow process, we first check to see if the author provided by the user is in fact an active username. This is done with a simple call to the blockchain which returns an array of all the user information. If the author does not exist, the return value is null.\n\n#capture variables\nauthor = input('Author to follow: ')\n\n#check author status\nresult = s.get_account(author)\n\n\nOnce the author name is confirmed to be valid we can move on to check the follow status of that author.\n\n4. Follow status\n\nIf the author check comes back with a value we use a simple if statement to initialise the database query for the follow status. A comprehensive tutorial is available to retrieve a list of followers and users that are being followed in the tutorial specified in the intro. As we are only interested in a very specific author we can narrow the query results down to a single result. That result then determines what the available actions are.\n\n#result from previous step\nif result :\n\t#check for author name in the current following list\n\tfollow = s.get_following(username, author, 'blog', 1)\n\tif len(follow) &gt; 0 and follow[0]['following'] == author :\n\t\ttitle = \"Author is already being followed, please choose action\"\n\telse:\n\t\ttitle = \"Author has not yet been followed, please choose action\"\nelse:\n\tprint('Author does not exist')\n\texit()\n\n\nThe result from the follow query is printed on the UI and the user is asked to select the next action to take based on that information. If the author does not exit the program exits automatically.\n\n#get index and selected action\noptions = ['Follow', 'Unfollow', 'Exit']\noption, index = pick(options, title)\n\n\nOnce we know what the user wants to do, we can move on to the actual commit to the blockchain.\n\n5. Follow/Unfollow commit\n\nOnce the user has selected which action to take we user another if statement to execute that selection.\n\nif option == 'Follow' :\n\ts.commit.follow(author, ['blog'], username)\n\tprint(author + ' is now being followed')\nelse:\n\tif option == 'Unfollow' :\n\t\ts.commit.unfollow(author, ['blog'], username)\n\t\tprint(author + ' has now been unfollowed')\n\telse:\n\t\tprint('Action Cancelled')\n\n\nA simple confirmation of the chosen action is printed on the screen.\n\nYou can also check on the testportal for a list of the authors being followed by the demo account.\n\nTo Run the tutorial\n\n\n  review dev requirements\n  clone this repo\n  cd tutorials/18_follow_a_user\n  pip install -r requirements.txt\n  python index.py\n  After a few moments, you should see a prompt for input in terminal screen."

Since we don’t have predefined account list, we will fetch newly created posts and show their authors for selection and give option to choose one account to get its comments. get_discussions_by_comments function fetches list of comments made by account. Note that get_discussions_by_created filter is used for fetching 5 posts and after selection of its author tutorial uses author of the post to fetch that account’s comments.\n\nSteps\n\n\n  App setup - Library install and import\n  Post list - List of posts to select from created filter\n  Comments list - Get comments list made by selected account\n  Print output - Print results in output\n\n\n1. App setup \n\nIn this tutorial we use 3 packages, pick - helps us to select filter interactively. steem - steem-python library, interaction with Blockchain. pprint - print results in better format.\n\nFirst we import all three library and initialize Steem class\n\n    import pprint\n    from pick import pick\n    # initialize Steem class\n    from steem import Steem\n\n    s = Steem()\n\n\n2.

We are using the get_vesting_delegations and get_expiring_vesting_delegations methods found within the steem class in the library. Each of these functions are executed separately. It should be noted that when a delegation is cancelled the VESTS will only be available again after 7 days. The value of the delegation can also be changed at any time, either decreased or increased. To get active delegations we need the following parameters:\n\n\n  account - The user account that the delegation list is being queried for\n  from-account - The account name from where to start the search. This parameter can be left empty to pull a list from the first delegatee\n  limit - The maximum amount of delegations that will be returned by the query\n\n\nThe function to query the expiring delegations use the the same parameters except that the start_account is replaced by a start_date. If this value is greater than 7 days from present, it will always include all delegations that are pending expiration.\n\nSteps\n\n\n  App setup - Library install and import. Connection to production\n  User input - Input user and limit parameters\n  Delegation lists - Selection of the type of list and blockchain query\n\n\n1. App setup \n\nIn this tutorial we use 2 package:\n\n\n  steem - steem-python library and interaction with Blockchain\n  pick - helps select the query type interactively\n\n\nWe import the libraries and connect to the production server.\n\nfrom pick import pick\nfrom steem import Steem\n\nimport pprint\n\nclient = Steem()\n\n\npprint is used to print the query results in an easier to read format\n\n2. User input \n\nThe account and limit parameters are assigned via input from the console/terminal. We also check if the username provided does in fact exist on the blockchain using the get_account method also found within the steem class. This will return an null value if the name does not exist.\n\n#capture username\nusername = input('Username: ')\n\n#check username\nresult = client.get_account(username)\nif not result:\n\tprint('Invalid username')\n\texit()\n\n#capture list limit\nlimit = input('Max number of vesting delegations to display: ')\n\n\n3. Delegation lists \n\nWe use two different functions to query active and expiring delegations, so the user is given a choice on which of these lists he wants to view.\n\n#list type\ntitle = 'Please choose the type of list: '\noptions = ['Active Vesting Delegations', 'Expiring Vesting Delegations']\n\n#get index and selected list name\noption, index = pick(options, title)\nprint('\\n' + 'List of ' + option + ': ' + '\\n')\n\n\nBased on the result of the choice, the relevant blockchain query is executed and the result of the query displayed on the console/terminal.\n\nif option=='Active Vesting Delegations' :\n    #active delegations\n\tdelegations = client.get_vesting_delegations(username, '', limit)\n\tif len(delegations) == 0:\n\t\tprint('No ' + option)\n\telse:\n\t\tpprint.pprint(delegations)\nelse:\n    #expiring delegations\n\tdelegations = client.get_expiring_vesting_delegations(username, \"2018-01-01T00:00:00\", limit)\n\tif len(delegations) == 0:\n\t\tprint('No ' + option)\n\telse:\n\t\tpprint.pprint(delegations)\n\n\nFor both the queries the starting points were defined in such a way as to include all available data but this can be changed depending on the user requirements.\n\nThat’s it!\n\nTo Run the tutorial\n\n\n  review dev requirements\n  clone this repo\n  cd tutorials/29_get_delegations_by_user\n  pip install -r requirements.txt\n  python index.py\n  After a few moments, you should see a prompt for input in terminal screen."

These functions allow us to query the Steem blockchain in order to retrieve either a list of authors that are being followed or a list of authors that are currently following a specified user. There are 4 parameters required to execute these functions:\n\n\n  account - The specific user for which the follower(ing) list will be retrieved\n  start follower(ing) - The starting letter(s) or name for the search query. This value can be set as an empty string in order to include all authors starting from “a”\n  follow type - This value is set to blog and includes all users following or being followed by the user. This is currently the only valid parameter value for this function to execute correctly.\n  limit - The maximum number of lines that can be returned by the query\n\n\nSteps\n\n\n  App setup - Library install and import\n  Input variables - Collecting the required inputs via the UI\n  Get followers/following Get the followers or users being followed\n  Print output - Print results in output\n\n\n1. App setup \n\nIn this tutorial we use 2 packages, pick - helps us to select the query type interactively. steem - steem-python library, interaction with Blockchain.\n\nFirst we import both libraries and initialize Steem class\n\nfrom pick import pick\nfrom steem import Steem\n\ns = Steem()\n\n\n2. Input variables \n\nWe assign two of the variables via a simple input from the UI.\n\n#capture username\nusername = input(\"Username: \")\n\n#capture list limit\nlimit = input(\"Max number of followers(ing) to display: \")\n\n\nNext we make a list of the two list options available to the user, following or followers and setup pick.\n\n#list type\ntitle = 'Please choose the type of list: '\noptions = ['Follower', 'Following']\n\n#get index and selected list name\noption, index = pick(options, title)\nprint(\"List of \" + option)\n\n\nThis will show the two options as a list to select in terminal/command prompt. From there we can determine which function to execute. We also display the choice on the UI for clarity.\n\n3. Get followers/following \n\nNow that we know which function we will be using, we can form the query to send to the blockchain. The selection is done with a simple if statement.\n\nif option==\"Follower\" :\n    follow = s.get_followers(username, '', 'blog', limit)\n    # for follower in follow:\n    #     lists.append(follower[\"follower\"])\n    # print(*lists, sep='\\n')\nelse:\n    follow = s.get_following(username, '', 'blog', limit)\n    # for following in follow:\n    #     lists.append(following[\"following\"])\n    # print(*lists, sep='\\n')\n\n\nThe output is displayed using the same if statement and will be discussed in the next step.\n\n4. Print output \n\nNext, we will print the result.\n\nif option==\"Follower\" :\n    # follow = s.get_followers(username, '', 'blog', limit)\n    for follower in follow:\n        lists.append(follower[\"follower\"])\n    print(*lists, sep='\\n')\nelse:\n    # follow = s.get_following(username, '', 'blog', limit)\n    for following in follow:\n        lists.append(following[\"following\"])\n    print(*lists, sep='\\n')\n\n\nThe query returns an array of objects. We use the for loop to build a list of only the followers(ing) from that array and then display the list on the UI with line separators. This creates an easy to read list of authors.\n\nWe also do a check for when the list is empty to display the proper message.\n\n#check if follower(ing) list is empty\nif len(lists) == 0:\n    print(\"No \"+option+\" information available\")\n\n\nThis is a fairly simple example of how to use these functions but we encourage you to play around with the parameters to gain further understanding of possible results.\n\nTo Run the tutorial\n\n\n  review dev requirements\n  clone this repo\n  cd tutorials/19_get_follower_and_following_list\n  pip install -r requirements.txt\n  python index.py\n  After a few moments, you should see output in terminal/command prompt screen."

Note that get_discussions_by_active filter is used for fetching 5 posts which by default contains active_votes of each post, but for purpose of this tutorial we will use get_active_votes function to fetch voters info.\n\nSteps\n\n\n  App setup - Library install and import\n  Post list - List of posts to select from created filter\n  Voters list - Get voters list for selected post\n  Print output - Print results in output\n\n\n1. App setup \n\nIn this tutorial we use 3 packages, pick - helps us to select filter interactively. steem - steem-python library, interaction with Blockchain. pprint - print results in better format.\n\nFirst we import all three library and initialize Steem class\n\n    import pprint\n    from pick import pick\n    # initialize Steem class\n    from steem import Steem\n\n    s = Steem()\n\n\n2. Post list \n\nNext we will fetch and make list of posts and setup pick properly.\n\n    query = {\n        \"limit\":5, #number of posts\n        \"tag\":\"\" #tag of posts\n        }\n    #post list for selected query\n    posts = s.get_discussions_by_active(query)\n\n    title = 'Please choose post: '\n    options = []\n    #posts list options\n    for post in posts:\n        options.append(post[\"author\"]+'/'+post[\"permlink\"])\n    # get index and selected filter name\n    option, index = pick(options, title)\n\n\nThis will show us list of posts to select in terminal/command prompt. And after selection we will get index and post name to index and option variables.\n\n3. Voters list \n\nNext we will fetch active votes on selected post with get_active_votes. By default get_discussions_by_active function already contains active_votes list, but for this tutorial purpose we will ignore all other fields but only use author and permlink fields to fetch voters list.\n\n\nvoters = s.get_active_votes(posts[index][\"author\"],posts[index][\"permlink\"])\n\n\n4. Print output \n\nNext, we will print result, details of selected post.\n\n    # print voters list for selected post\n    pprint.pprint(voters)\n    pprint.pprint(\"Selected: \"+option)\n\n\nThe example of result returned from the service is a JSON object with the following properties:\n\n[{'percent': 100,\n  'reputation': '4675452335798',\n  'rshares': 174045922,\n  'time': '2018-06-13T05:27:06',\n  'voter': 'ubg',\n  'weight': 663},\n {'percent': 3000,\n  'reputation': 0,\n  'rshares': '52213408920',\n  'time': '2018-06-13T12:53:30',\n  'voter': 'warofcraft',\n  'weight': 99589},\n {'percent': 10000,\n  'reputation': '16976056264304',\n  'rshares': '41495494555',\n  'time': '2018-06-13T08:56:00',\n  'voter': 'jiahn',\n  'weight': 80257}\n]\n'Selected: steemitblog/join-team-steemit-at-tokenfest'\n\n\nFrom this result you have access to everything associated to the voter including reputation of voter, timestamp, voter’s account name, percent and weight of vote, rshares reward shares values that you can be use in further development of application with Python.\n\nThat’s it!\n\nTo Run the tutorial\n\n\n  review dev requirements\n  clone this repo\n  cd tutorials/06_get_voters_list\n  pip install -r requirements.txt\n  python index.py\n  After a few moments, you should see output in terminal/command prompt screen."

This can be useful in setting up a secondary account(s) to manage funds for a main account or having a backup should you lose passwords for the main account.\n\nOne of the common practice nowadays is to lend/delegate SP to another account, above same technique can be used to create market around it with minimum 3rd party trust. All your funds stay in your account. You can use/create automated system where you can lease for certain period of time and system can take care of payments and release of delegations (notify clients). Even better, you can use multi-signature feature to establish 100% trust where clients will have to confirm, approve transactions.\n\nActive permissions and authority should be used with utmost care, you don’t want to lose your funds. It is really not easy to hack Steem accounts, let alone take control over it. But without careful use (revealing private keys) losing liquid funds are not that difficult and it takes only couple seconds to do that, keeping most value powered up always helps.\n\nthis article has more detail around active authorities\n\nIntro\n\nThe Steem python library has a built-in function to transmit transactions to the blockchain. We are using the allow and disallow methods found within the commit class in the library. Before we grant or revoke permission, we use the get_account function to check whether the requested user already has that permission or not. This is not strictly necessary but adds to the useability of the process. The allow method has 5 parameters:\n\n\n  foreign - The foreign account that will obtain access\n  weight - This is an optional parameter defining the weight to use. If not defined, the threshold value will be used. If the weight is smaller than the threshold, additional signatures will be required.\n  permission - The actual permission to modify. This value must be either “posting”, “active” or “owner”\n  account - The account to allow access to\n  threshold - The threshold that needs to be reached by signatures to be able to interact\n\n\nThe disallow method uses the same parameters except for weight which is not required.\n\nThere is currently a bug with the disallow method when using it on the testnet that we normally connect to. Due to that bug, we are using the production server for this tutorial. Special care should be taken when creating transactions as everything we do will affect real accounts.\n\nSteps\n\n\n  App setup - Library install and import. Input user info and connection to production\n  Username validation - Check validity of user and foreign account\n  Check permission status - Check current permission status of foreign account\n  Commit to blockchain - Commit transaction to blockchain\n\n\n1. App setup and connection \n\nIn this tutorial we use 2 packages:\n\n\n  steem - steem-python library and interaction with Blockchain\n  pick - helps select the query type interactively\n\n\nWe import the libraries for the application.\n\nimport steembase\nimport steem\nfrom pick import pick\n\n\nWe require the private active key of the user in order for the allow or disallow to be committed to the blockchain. The values are supplied via the terminal/console before we initialise the steem class with the supplied private key included.\n\n#capture user information\nusername = input('Enter username: ')\nwif = input('Enter private ACTIVE key: ')\n\n#connect to production server with active key\nclient = steem.Steem(keys=[wif])\n\n\n2. Username validation \n\nBoth the main account granting the permission and the account that permission is being granted to are first checked to make certain that they do in fact exist. We do this with the get_account function.\n\n#check valid user\nuserinfo = client.get_account(username)\nif(userinfo is None) :\n    print('Oops. Looks like user ' + username + ' doesn\\'t exist on this chain!')\n    exit()\n\n#get account to authorise and check if valid\nforeign_acc = input('Please enter the account name for ACTIVE authorisation: ')\nif (foreign_acc == username) :\n    print('Cannot allow or disallow active permission to your own account')\n    exit()\nforeign_userinfo = client.get_account(foreign_acc)\nif(foreign_userinfo is None) :\n    print('Oops. Looks like user ' + foreign_acc + ' doesn\\'t exist on this chain!')\n    exit()\n\n\n3. Check permission status \n\nIn order to determine which function to execute (allow or disallow) we first need to check whether the requested user already has permission or not. We do this with the same variable created in the previous step. The get_account function has a value - active - that contains an array of the all the usernames that has been granted active permission for the account being queried. We use this check to limit the options of the user as you cannot grant permission to a user that already has permission or revoke permission of a user that does not yet have permission. The information is displayed on the options list.\n\n#check if foreign_account already has active auth\n_data = []\ntitle = ''\nfor i in range(len(userinfo['active']['account_auths'])) :\n    _data.append(userinfo['active']['account_auths'][i])\n    if (_data[i][0] == foreign_acc) :\n        title = (foreign_acc + ' already has active permission. Please choose option from below list')\n        options = ['DISALLOW', 'CANCEL']\n\nif (title == '') :\n    title = (foreign_acc + ' does not yet active permission. Please choose option from below list')\n    options = ['ALLOW', 'CANCEL']\n\n\n4. Commit to blockchain \n\nBased on the check in the previous step, the user is given the option to allow, disallow or cancel the operation completely. All the required parameters have already been assigned via console/terminal input and based on the choice of the user the relevant function can be executed. A confirmation of the succesfully executed action is displayed on the UI.\n\noption, index = pick(options, title)\n\nif (option == 'CANCEL') :\n    print('operation cancelled')\n    exit()\n\nif (option == 'ALLOW') :\n    #allow(foreign, weight=None, permission='posting', account=None, threshold=None)\n    client.allow(foreign=foreign_acc, weight=1, permission='active', account=username, threshold=1)\n    print(foreign_acc + ' has been granted active permission')\nelse :\n    #disallow(foreign, permission='posting', account=None, threshold=None)\n    client.disallow(foreign=foreign_acc, permission='active', account=username, threshold=1)\n    print('active permission for ' + foreign_acc + ' has been removed')\n\n\nAnd that’s it!\n\nTo Run the tutorial\n\n\n  review dev requirements\n  clone this repo\n  cd tutorials/31_grant_active_permission\n  pip install -r requirements.txt\n  python index.py\n  After a few moments, you should see a prompt for input in terminal screen."

We are using the withdraw_vesting method found within the commit class in the library. When you power down, the converted VESTS (STEEM POWER) will not be available as STEEM immediately. It is converted in 13 equal parts and transferred into your STEEM wallet weekly, the first portion only being available a week after the power down was initiated. Before we do the conversion, we check the current balance of the account to check how much STEEM POWER is available. This is not strictly necessary as the process will automatically abort with the corresponding error, but it does give some insight into the process as a whole. We use the get_account function to check for this. The withdraw_vesting method has 2 parameters:\n\n\n  amount - The amount of VESTS that will be withdrawn. This must be of the float data type\n  account - The specified user account for the transfer\n\n\nSteps\n\n\n  App setup - Library install and import. Connection to testnet\n  User information and steem node - Input user information and connection to Steem node\n  Check balance - Check current vesting balance of user account\n  Conversion amount and commit - Input of VESTS amount to convert and commit to blockchain\n\n\n1. App setup \n\nIn this tutorial we use 2 packages:\n\n\n  steem - steem-python library and interaction with Blockchain\n  pick - helps select the query type interactively\n\n\nWe import the libraries and connect to the testnet.\n\nimport steembase\nimport steem\nfrom pick import pick\nfrom steem.amount import Amount\n\nsteembase.chains.known_chains['STEEM'] = {\n    'chain_id': '79276aea5d4877d9a25892eaa01b0adf019d3e5cb12a97478df3298ccdd01673',\n    'prefix': 'STX', 'steem_symbol': 'STEEM', 'sbd_symbol': 'SBD', 'vests_symbol': 'VESTS'\n}\n\n\nBecause this tutorial alters the blockchain we connect to the testnet so we don’t create spam on the production server.\n\n2. User information and steem node \n\nWe require the private active key of the user in order for the conversion to be committed to the blockchain. This is why we have to specify this alongside the testnet node. The values are supplied via the terminal/console before we initialise the steem class. There is a demo account available to use with this tutorial but any account that is set up on the testnet can be used.\n\n#capture user information\nusername = input('Enter username: ') #demo account: cdemo\nwif = input('Enter private ACTIVE key: ') #demo account: 5KaNM84WWSqzwKzY82fXPaUW43idbLnPqf5SfjGxLfw6eV2kAP3\n\n#connect node and private active key\nclient = steem.Steem(nodes=['https://testnet.steem.vc'], keys=[wif])\n\n\n3. Check balance \n\nIn order to give the user enough information to make the conversion we check the current balance of the account using the get_account function.\n\n#get account balance for vesting shares\nuserinfo = client.get_account(username)\ndelegated_vests = userinfo['delegated_vesting_shares']\nvesting_shares = userinfo['vesting_shares']\nto_withdraw = float(userinfo['to_withdraw'])\nwithdrawn = float(userinfo['withdrawn'])\n\navailable_vests = (Amount(vesting_shares).amount - Amount(delegated_vests).amount - \n     ((to_withdraw - withdrawn)/1000000))\n\nprint('VESTS currently powering down: ' + str(to_withdraw/1000000) + ' VESTS' +\n    '\\n' + 'Available VESTS: ' + str(available_vests) + ' VESTS')\n\ninput('\\n' + 'Press enter to continue' + '\\n')\n\n\nThe available vesting shares to withdraw is not directly available from the user information and needs to be calculated. In order to find the total VESTS available to power down we need to know how much is currently in power down, how much has been delegated and then the total amount of vesting shares. The values are assigned from the query directly as float type to make the calculations a little simpler. The results of the query and calculation are converted to string type and displayed in the console/terminal.\n\n4. Conversion amount and commit \n\nThe user is given the option to withdraw all available vesting shares, a portion of the shares or to cancel the transaction completely.\n\n#choice of transfer\ntitle = 'Please choose an option: '\noptions = ['Power down ALL', 'Power down PORTION', 'Cancel Transaction']\noption, index = pick(options, title)\n\n\nBased on the input from the user the amount variable can be assigned and the transaction committed to the blockchain. The amount must be between zero and the total amount of vesting shares (both pending conversion and available VESTS combined). The amount you set to be withdrawn will override the current amount of vesting shares pending withdrawal. If for example the user enters a new amount of ‘0’ shares to be withdrawn, it will cancel the current withdrawal completely.\n\n#parameters: amount, account\nif (option == 'Cancel Transaction') :\n    print('transaction cancelled')\n    exit()\nelse :\n    if (option == 'Power down ALL') :\n        if (available_vests == 0) :\n            print('No change to withdraw amount')\n        else :\n            amount = to_withdraw/1000000 + available_vests\n            client.withdraw_vesting(amount, username)\n            print(str(amount) + ' VESTS now powering down')\n    else :\n        amount = float(input('Please enter the amount of VESTS you would like to power down: '))\n        if (amount &lt; (to_withdraw/1000000 + available_vests)) :\n            client.withdraw_vesting(amount, username)\n            print(str(amount) + ' VESTS now powering down')\n        else :\n            if (amount == to_withdraw/1000000) :\n                print('No change to withdraw amount')\n            else :\n                print('insufficient funds available')\n\n\nThe result is displayed on the console/terminal.\n\nWe encourage users to play around with different values and data types to fully understand how this process works. You can also check the balances and transaction history on the testnet portal.\n\nTo Run the tutorial\n\n\n  review dev requirements\n  clone this repo\n  cd tutorials/25_power_down\n  pip install -r requirements.txt\n  python index.py\n  After a few moments, you should see a prompt for input in terminal screen."

We are using the transfer_to_vesting method found within the commit class in the library. When you power up you convert your STEEM into STEEM POWER to increase your influence on Steemit. Before we do the conversion, we use the get_account function to check the current STEEM balance of the account to see what is available to power up. This is not strictly necessary but adds to the useability of the process. The transfer_to_vesting method has 3 parameters:\n\n\n  amount - The amount of STEEM to power up. This must be of the float data type\n  to - The account to where the STEEM will be powered up\n  account - The source user account for the transfer\n\n\nSteps\n\n\n  App setup - Library install and import. Connection to testnet\n  User information and steem node - Input user information and connection to Steem node\n  Check balance - Check current vesting balance of user account\n  Conversion amount - Input power up amount and check valid transfer\n  Commit to blockchain - Commit transaction to blockchain\n\n\n1. App setup \n\nIn this tutorial we use 2 packages:\n\n\n  steem - steem-python library and interaction with Blockchain\n  pick - helps select the query type interactively\n\n\nWe import the libraries and connect to the testnet.\n\nimport steembase\nimport steem\nfrom steem.amount import Amount\nfrom pick import pick\n\nsteembase.chains.known_chains['STEEM'] = {\n    'chain_id': '79276aea5d4877d9a25892eaa01b0adf019d3e5cb12a97478df3298ccdd01673',\n    'prefix': 'STX', 'steem_symbol': 'STEEM', 'sbd_symbol': 'SBD', 'vests_symbol': 'VESTS'\n}\n\n\nBecause this tutorial alters the blockchain we connect to a testnet so we don’t create spam on the production server.\n\n2. User information and steem node \n\nWe require the private active key of the user in order for the conversion to be committed to the blockchain. This is why we are using a testnet. The values are supplied via the terminal/console before we initialise the steem class. There are some demo accounts available but we encourage you to create your own accounts on this testnet and create balances you can claim; it’s good practice.\n\n#capture user information\nusername = input('Enter username: ') #demo account: cdemo\nwif = input('Enter private ACTIVE key: ') #demo account: 5KaNM84WWSqzwKzY82fXPaUW43idbLnPqf5SfjGxLfw6eV2kAP3\n\n#connect node and private active key\nclient = steem.Steem(nodes=['https://testnet.steem.vc'], keys=[wif])\n\n\n3. Check balance \n\nIn order to give the user enough information to make the conversion we check the current balance of the account using the get_account function.\n\n#check valid user and get account balance\nuserinfo = client.get_account(username)\nif(userinfo is None) :\n    print('Oops. Looks like user ' + username + ' doesn\\'t exist on this chain!')\n    exit()\nbalance = userinfo['balance']\n\nprint('Available STEEM balance: ' + balance + '\\n')\n\ninput('Press any key to continue')\n\n\nThe results of the query are displayed in the console/terminal.\n\n4. Conversion amount \n\nBoth the amount and the to parameters are assigned via input from the terminal/console. The user is given the option to power up the STEEM to their own account or to another user’s account. The amount has to be greater than zero and no more than the total available STEEM of the user. If you are using one of Steemit’s demo accounts, please leave some STEEM for others to power up! We also check the to account to make sure it’s a valid account name.\n\n#choice of account\ntitle = 'Please choose an option for an account to transfer to: '\noptions = ['SELF', 'OTHER']\noption, index = pick(options, title)\n\nif (option == 'OTHER') :\n    #account to power up to\n    to_account = input('Please enter the ACCOUNT to where the STEEM will be transferred: ')\n    #check valid username\n    result = client.get_account(to_account)\n    if (not result) :\n        print(to_account + ' doesn\\'t exist on this chain!')\n        exit()\nelse :\n    print('\\n' + 'Power up STEEM to own account' + '\\n')\n    to_account = username\n\n#amount to power up\namount = float(input('Please enter the amount of STEEM to power up: '))\n\n\n5. Commit to blockchain \n\nNow that all the parameters have been assigned we can continue with the actual transmission to the blockchain. The output and commit is based on the validity of the amount that has been input.\n\n#parameters: amount, to, account\nif (amount == 0) :\n    print('\\n' + 'No STEEM entered for powering up')\n    exit()\nelse :\n    if (amount &gt; Amount(balance).amount) :\n        print('\\n' + 'Insufficient funds available')\n        exit()\n    else :\n        client.transfer_to_vesting(amount, to_account, username)\n        print('\\n' + str(amount) + ' STEEM has been powered up successfully')\n\n\nThe result of the power up transfer is displayed on the console/terminal.\n\nAs an added check we also display the new STEEM balance of the user on the terminal/console\n\n#get new account balance\nuserinfo = client.get_account(username)\nbalance = userinfo['balance']\nprint('New STEEM balance: ' + balance)\n\n\nWe encourage users to play around with different values and data types to fully understand how this process works.

These functions allow us to query the Steem blockchain in order to retrieve either a list of active authors or a list of trending tags. The option is available to either get a complete list starting from the first value on the blockchain or starting the list from any other closest match string value as provided by the user. Both of these functions have only two parameters:\n\n\n  account/aftertag - The string value from where to start the search. If this value is left empty the search will start from the first value available\n  limit - The maximum number of names/tags that the query retrieves\n\n\nSteps\n\n\n  App setup - Library import and Steem class initialisation\n  List selection - Selection of the type of list\n  Get and display account names - Get a list of account names from the blockchain\n  Get and display trending tags - Get a list of trending tags from the blockchain\n\n\n1. App setup\n\nIn this tutorial we use 2 packages, pick - helps us to select the query type interactively. steem - steem-python library for interaction with the Blockchain.\n\nFirst we import both libraries and initialize Steem class\n\nfrom steem import Steem\nfrom pick import pick\n\n\ns = Steem()\n\n\n2. List selection\n\nThe user is given the option of which list to create, active accounts or trending tags. We create this option list and setup pick.\n\n#choose list type\ntitle = 'Please select type of list:'\noptions = ['Active Account names', 'Trending tags']\n\n#get index and selected list name\noption, index = pick(options, title)\n\n\nThis will show the two options as a list to select in terminal/command prompt. From there we can determine which function to execute.\n\n3. Get and display account names\n\nOnce the user selects the required list, a simple if statement is used to execute the relevant function. Based on the selection we then run the query. The parameters for the lookup_accounts function is captured in the if statement via the terminal/console.\n\nif option=='Active Account names' :\n\t#capture starting account\n\taccount = input(\"Enter account name to start search from: \")\n\t#input list limit\n\tlimit = input(\"Enter max number of accounts to display: \")\n\tlists = s.lookup_accounts(account, limit)\n\tprint('\\n' + \"List of \" + option + '\\n')\n\tprint(*lists, sep='\\n')\n\n\nOnce the list is generated it is displayed on the UI with line separators along with a heading of what list it is.\n\n4. Get and display trending tags\n\nThe query for a list of trending tags is executed in the second part of the if statement. Again, the parameters for the query is captured via the terminal/console.\n\nelse :\n\t#capture starting tag\n\taftertag = input(\"Enter tag name to start search from: \")\n\t#capture list limit\n\tlimit = input(\"Enter max number of tags to display: \")\n\tlists = s.get_trending_tags(aftertag, limit)\n\tprint('\\n' + \"List of \" + option + '\\n')\n\tfor names in lists :\n\t\tprint(names[\"name\"])\n\n\nThe query returns an array of objects. We use the for loop to build a list of only the tag names from that array and then display the list on the UI with line separators. This creates an easy to read list of tags.\n\nThat’s it!.\n\nTo Run the tutorial\n\n\n  review dev requirements\n  clone this repo\n  cd tutorials/15_search_accounts\n  pip install -r requirements.txt\n  python index.py\n  After a few moments, you should see output in terminal/command prompt screen."

  							"content": "Full, runnable src of Submit Comment Reply can be downloaded as part of the PY tutorials repository.\n\n\nThis tutorial will explain and show you how to submit a new comment to the Steem blockchain using the commit class found within the steem-python library.\n\nIntro\n\nThe Steem python library has a built-in function to transmit transactions to the blockchain. We are using the post method found within the commit class in the the library. It should be noted that comments and post are both treated as a commit.post operation with the only difference being that a comment/reply has an additional parameter containing the parent post/comment. There are 11 parameters within the post method:\n\n\n  title - The title of the post. This is a required parameter but comments don’t have a title so the parameter is assigned an empty string value\n  body - The body of the post\n  author - The account that you are posting from\n  permlink - A unique adentifier for the\n  tags - Between 1 and 5 key words that defines the post\n  reply_idendifier - Identifier of the parent post(used for comments)\n  json_metadata - JSON meta objec that can be attached to the post\n  comment_options - JSON options object that can be attached to the post to specify additional options like ‘max_payouts’, ‘allow_votes’, etc.\n  community - Name of the community you are posting into\n  beneficiaries - A list of beneficiaries for posting reward distribution.\n  self_vote - Upvote the post as author right after posting\n\n\nWe will only be using the parameters titel, body, author, permlink and reply_identifier as they are all that is required for a basic comment operation. If you want to explore the other parameters further you can find more information HERE.\n\nA comment made on a post is defined as a root comment. You can also comment on someone elses (or your own) comment, in which case the parent parameters would be that of the comment, and not the original post.\n\nSteps\n\n\n  App setup - Library install and import. Connection to Steem node\n  Variable input and format - Input and creation of varialbes\n  Initialize steem class - Initialize the steem class with the relevant node and private key\n  Post submission and result - Committing of transaction to the blockchain\n\n\n1. App setup \n\nIn this tutorial we use 4 packages:\n\n\n  random and string - used to create a random string used for the permlink\n  steem - steem-python library and interaction with Blockchain\n  steembase - used to connect to the testnet\n\n\nWe import the libraries and connect to the testnet.\n\nimport random\nimport string\nimport steembase\nimport steem\n\nsteembase.chains.known_chains['STEEM'] = {\n    'chain_id': '79276aea5d4877d9a25892eaa01b0adf019d3e5cb12a97478df3298ccdd01673',\n    'prefix': 'STX', 'steem_symbol': 'STEEM', 'sbd_symbol': 'SBD', 'vests_symbol': 'VESTS'\n}\n\n\nBecause this tutorial alters the blockchain we have to connect to the testnet. There is a demo account available for use, cdemo with private posting key 5JEZ1EiUjFKfsKP32b15Y7jybjvHQPhnvCYZ9BW62H1LDUnMvHz. You can also create your own demo account by following the instructions on the TESTNET site.\n\n2. Variable input and format\n\nThe variables are captured via a simple string input and allocated as seen below. The wif variable is the private posting key of the user making the comment. This key is required to commit the post to the blockchain.\n\n#capture variables\nparentAuthor = input('Parent author: ')\nparentPermlink = input('Parent permlink: ')\nauthor = input('Username: ')\nwif = input('Private posting key: ')\nbody = input('Comment Body: ')\n\n\nWe join the two parent values and assign it to the reply_identifier parameter. We also use a random generator to create a new permlink for the post being created\n\n#combining parent values to create reply identifier\nreply_identifier = '/'.join([parentAuthor,parentPermlink])\n\n#random generator to create post permlink\npermlink = ''.join(random.choices(string.digits, k=10))\n\n\nThe random generator is limited to 10 characters in this case but the permlink can be up to 256 bytes. If the permlink value is left empty then it auto creates a permlink based on the title of the post. The permlink is unique to the author only which means that multiple authors can have the same title for thier post.\n\n3. Initialize steem class\n\nWe initialize the steem class by connecting to the specific testnet node. We also require the private posting key of the contributing author in order to commit the post which is also specified during this operation.\n\n#connect node and private posting key\nclient = steem.Steem(nodes=['https://testnet.steem.vc'], keys=[wif])\n\n\n4. Post submission and result\n\nThe last step is to transmit the post through to the blockchain. This is done with the post method within the commit class. All the defined parameters are submitted with the function. As stated earlier in the tutorial, there are quite a few parameters for this function but for a basic comment these 5 are all that’s required.\n\n#commit post to blockchain\nclient.commit.post(title='', body=body, author=author, permlink=permlink, reply_identifier=reply_identifier)\n\nprint(\"Comment created successfully\")\nprint(permlink)\n\n\nA simple confirmation is printed on the screen if the comment is committed successfully. We also print the permlink for the comment on screen.

We are using the post method found within the commit class in the the library. It should be noted that comments and new post are both treated as commit.post operation with the only difference being that a comment/reply has got an additional parameter containing the parent post/comment. There are 11 parameters within the post method:\n\n\n  title - The title of the post\n  body - The body of the post\n  author - The account that you are posting from\n  permlink - A unique adentifier for the\n  tags - Between 1 and 5 key words that defines the post\n  reply_idendifier - Identifier of the parent post(used for comments)\n  json_metadata - JSON meta objec that can be attached to the post\n  comment_options - JSON options object that can be attached to the post to specify additional options like ‘max_payouts’, ‘allow_votes’, etc.\n  community - Name of the community you are posting into\n  beneficiaries - A list of beneficiaries for posting reward distribution.\n  self_vote - Upvote the post as author right after posting\n\n\nWe will only be using the first 5 parameters as these are the only ones required to create a basic post. If you want to explore the other parameters further you can find more information HERE.\n\nSteps\n\n\n  App setup - Library install and import. Connection to Steem node\n  Variable input and format - Input and creation of varialbes\n  Post submission and result - Committing of transaction to the blockchain\n\n\n1. App setup \n\nIn this tutorial we use 4 packages:\n\n\n  random and string - used to create a random string used for the permlink\n  steem - steem-python library and interaction with Blockchain\n  steembase - used to connect to the testnet\n\n\nWe import the libraries, connect to the testnet and initialize the Steem class.\n\nimport random\nimport string\nimport steembase\nimport steem\n\nsteembase.chains.known_chains['STEEM'] = {\n    'chain_id': '79276aea5d4877d9a25892eaa01b0adf019d3e5cb12a97478df3298ccdd01673',\n    'prefix': 'STX', 'steem_symbol': 'STEEM', 'sbd_symbol': 'SBD', 'vests_symbol': 'VESTS'\n}\n\n#connect node and private posting key\nclient = steem.Steem(nodes=['https://testnet.steem.vc'], keys=['5JEZ1EiUjFKfsKP32b15Y7jybjvHQPhnvCYZ9BW62H1LDUnMvHz'])\n\n\nBecause this tutorial alters the blockchain we have to connect to the testnet. We also require the private posting key of the contributing author in order to commit the post which is why it is specified along with the testnet node. We have supplied a test account, cdemo to use with this tutorial.\n\n2. Variable input and format\n\nThe first three variables are captured via a simple string input while the tags variable is captured in the form of an array.\n\n#capture variables\nauthor = input('Username: ')\ntitle = input('Post Title: ')\nbody = input('Post Body: ')\n\n#capture list of tags and separate by \" \"\ntaglimit = 2 #number of tags 1 - 5\ntaglist = []\nfor i in range(1, taglimit+1):\n\tprint(i)\n\ttag = input(' Tag : ')\n\ttaglist.append(tag)\n\n\nThe tags parameter needs to be in the form of a single string with the words split by an empty space, so we add a line to prepare that variable. We also use a random generator to create a new permlink for the post being created\n\n\" \".join(taglist) #create string joined with empty spaces\n\n#random generator to create post permlink\npermlink = ''.join(random.choices(string.digits, k=10))\n\n\nThe random generator is limited to 10 characters in this case but the permlink can be up to 256 bytes. If the permlink value is left empty then it auto creates a permlink based on the title of the post. The permlink is unique to the author only which means that multiple authors can have the same title for the thier post.\n\n3. Post submission and result\n\nThe last step is to transmit the post through to the blockchain. This is done post method within the commit class. All the defined parameters are submitted with the function. As stated earlier in the tutorial, there are quite a few parameters for this function but for a basic post these 5 are the most important.\n\nclient.commit.post(title=title, body=body, author=author, tags=taglist, permlink=permlink)\n\nprint(\"Post created successfully\")\n\n\nA simple confirmation is printed on the screen if the post is committed successfully.\n\nYou can also check on the testportal for the post.\n\nTo Run the tutorial\n\n\n  review dev requirements\n  clone this repo\n  cd tutorials/10_submit_post\n  pip install -r requirements.txt\n  python index.py\n  After a few moments, you should see a prompt for input in terminal screen."

We are using the transfer method found within the commit class in the library. Before we do the transfer, we check the current balance of the account to ensure that there are sufficient funds available. We also check if the intended recipient of the transfer is a valid user account. This is not strictly necessary as the process will automatically abort with the corresponding error, but it does give some insight into the process as a whole. We use the get_account function to check for this. The transfer method has 5 parameters:\n\n\n  to - The intended recipient of the funds transfer\n  amount - The amount of STEEM or SBD that the user wants to transfer. This parameter has to be of the float data type and is rounded up to 3 decimal spaces\n  asset - A string value specifying whether STEEM or SBD is being transferred\n  memo - An optional text field containing comments on the transfer. This value may begin with ‘#’ for encrypted messaging\n  account - The account that the funds are being transferred from\n\n\nSteps\n\n\n  App setup - Library install and import. Connection to testnet\n  User information and steem node - Input user information and connection to Steem node\n  Check balance - Check current STEEM and SBD balance of user account\n  Recipient input - Check for valid recipient account name\n  Transfer type and amount - Input of transfer type and the amount to transfer\n  Transfer commit - Commit of transfer to blockchain\n\n\n1. App setup \n\nIn this tutorial we use 2 packages:\n\n\n  steem - steem-python library and interaction with Blockchain\n  pick - helps select the query type interactively\n\n\nWe import the libraries and connect to the testnet.\n\nimport steembase\nimport steem\nfrom pick import pick\n\nsteembase.chains.known_chains['STEEM'] = {\n    'chain_id': '79276aea5d4877d9a25892eaa01b0adf019d3e5cb12a97478df3298ccdd01673',\n    'prefix': 'STX', 'steem_symbol': 'STEEM', 'sbd_symbol': 'SBD', 'vests_symbol': 'VESTS'\n}\n\n\nBecause this tutorial alters the blockchain we connect to the testnet so we don’t create spam on the production server.\n\n2. User information and steem node \n\nWe require the private active key of the user in order for the transfer to be committed to the blockchain. This is why we have to specify this alongside the testnet node. The values are supplied via the terminal/console before we initialise the steem class. There is a demo account available to use with this tutorial but any account that is set up on the testnet can be used.\n\n#capture user information\nusername = input('Enter username: ') #demo account: cdemo\nwif = input('Enter private ACTIVE key: ') #demo account: 5KaNM84WWSqzwKzY82fXPaUW43idbLnPqf5SfjGxLfw6eV2kAP3\n\n#connect node and private active key\nclient = steem.Steem(nodes=['https://testnet.steem.vc'], keys=[wif])\n\n\n3. Check balance \n\nIn order to give the user enough information to make the transfer we check the current balance of the account using the get_account function.\n\n#get account balance for STEEM and SBD\nuserinfo = client.get_account(username)\ntotal_steem = userinfo['balance']\ntotal_sbd = userinfo['sbd_balance']\n\nprint('CURRENT ACCOUNT BALANCE:' + '\\n' + total_steem + '\\n' + total_sbd + '\\n')\n\n\nThe result of the query is displayed in the console/terminal.\n\n4. Recipient input \n\nThe recipient account is input via the console/terminal and then a check is done whether that username does in fact exist.\n\n#get recipient name\nrecipient = input('Enter the user you wish to transfer funds to: ')\n\n#check for valid recipient name\nresult = client.get_account(recipient)\n\n\nThe query will return a null value if the account does not match to anything on the blockchain. This result is then used to determine the next step.\n\n5. Transfer type and amount \n\nIf the query in the previous step returns a valid result the user is then given a choice of transfer types or to cancel the operation completely. If the username is not found the process aborts.\n\nif result:\n    #choice of transfer\n    title = 'Please choose transfer type: '\n    options = ['STEEM', 'SBD', 'Cancel Transfer']\n    # get index and selected transfer type\n    option, index = pick(options, title)\nelse:\n    print('Invalid recipient for funds transfer')\n    exit()\n\n\nOnce the user chooses the type of transfer we proceed to assign the amount as well as the asset parameter.\n\nif option == 'Cancel Transfer':\n    print('Transaction cancelled')\n    exit()\nelse:\n    if option == 'STEEM':\n        #get STEEM transfer amount\n        amount = input('Enter amount of STEEM to transfer to ' + recipient + ': ')\n        asset = 'STEEM'\n    else:\n        #get SBD transfer amount\n        amount = input('Enter amount of SBD to transfer to ' + recipient + ': ')\n        asset = 'SBD'\n\n\n6. Transfer commit \n\nOnce all the parameters have been assigned we can proceed with the actual commit to the blockchain.\n\n#parameters: to, amount, asset, memo='', account\nclient.transfer(recipient, float(amount), asset, '', username)\nprint('\\n' + amount + ' ' + asset + ' has been transferred to ' + recipient)\n\n\nThe memo parameter can be left empty as in the above example. A simple confirmation is printed on the UI.\nAs an added confirmation we check the balance of the user again and display it on the UI. This is not required at all but it serves as a more definitive confirmation that the transfer has been completed correctly.\n\n#get remaining account balance for STEEM and SBD\nuserinfo = client.get_account(username)\ntotal_steem = userinfo['balance']\ntotal_sbd = userinfo['sbd_balance']\n\nprint('\\n' + 'REMAINING ACCOUNT BALANCE:' + '\\n' + total_steem + '\\n' + total_sbd + '\\n')\n\n\nWe encourage users to play around with different values and data types to fully understand how this process works. You can also check the balances and transaction history on the testnet portal.\n\nTo Run the tutorial\n\n\n  review dev requirements\n  clone this repo\n  cd tutorials/21_transfer_steem_and_sbd\n  pip install -r requirements.txt\n  python index.py\n  After a few moments, you should see a prompt for input in terminal screen."

The withdrawal can be cancelled at any point during this waiting period. This measure was put in place to reduce the risk of funds being stolen when accounts are hacked as it gives sufficient time to recover your account before your funds are transferred out. Storing your funds in your savings account is thus more secure than having them as available balances.\n\nSteemconnect offers an alternative to transferring STEEM and SBD with a “simple link” solution. Instead of running through a list of operations on your account, you can simply use a link similar to the one below substituting the four parameters with your own details. You will be prompted to enter your username and password before the transaction will be executed.\nhttps://steemconnect.com/sign/transfer-to-savings?from=username&amp;to=username&amp;amount=0.000%20STEEM&amp;memo=text\nThis is similar to the steemconnect links that have been covered in previous tutorials. For a list of signing operations that work in this manner you can go to https://v2.steemconnect.com/sign. There is also a steemconnect link for withdrawing funds.\n\nIntro\n\nThe Steem python library has a built-in function to transmit transactions to the blockchain. We are using the transfer_to_savings and transfer_from_savings methods found within the commit class in the library. Before we do the transfer, we use the get_account function to check the current STEEM and SBD balance of the account to see what funds are available to transfer or withdraw. This is not strictly necessary but adds to the useability of the process. The transfer_to_savings method has 5 parameters:\n\n\n  amount - The amount of STEEM or SBD that the user wants to transfer. This parameter has to be of the float data type and is rounded up to 3 decimal spaces\n  asset - A string value specifying whether STEEM or SBD is being transferred\n  memo - An optional text field containing comments on the transfer\n  to - The recipient savings account name. Funds can be transferred to any other users’ savings balance\n  account - The source account for the transfer\n\n\nand transfer_from_savings has 6 parameters:\n\n\n  amount - The amount of STEEM or SBD that the user wants to withdraw. This parameter has to be of the float data type and is rounded up to 3 decimal spaces\n  asset - A string value specifying whether STEEM or SBD is being withdrawn\n  memo - An optional text field containing comments on the withdrawal\n  request id - Integer identifier for tracking the withdrawal. This needs to be a unique number for a specified user\n  to - The recipient account name. Funds can be withdrawn to any other users’ available balance\n  account - The source account for the transfer\n\n\nSteps\n\n\n  App setup - Library install and import. Connection to testnet\n  User information and steem node - Input user information and connection to Steem node\n  Check balance - Check current STEEM and SBD balance of user account\n  Transfer type and amount - Input of transfer type and the amount to transfer\n  Transfer commit - Commit of transfer to blockchain\n\n\n1. App setup \n\nIn this tutorial we use 3 packages:\n\n\n  steem - steem-python library and interaction with Blockchain\n  pick - helps select the query type interactively\n  random - use to create random numbers\n\n\nWe import the libraries and connect to the testnet.\n\nimport steembase\nimport steem\nfrom pick import pick\nimport random\n\nsteembase.chains.known_chains['STEEM'] = {\n    'chain_id': '79276aea5d4877d9a25892eaa01b0adf019d3e5cb12a97478df3298ccdd01673',\n    'prefix': 'STX', 'steem_symbol': 'STEEM', 'sbd_symbol': 'SBD', 'vests_symbol': 'VESTS'\n}\n\n\nBecause this tutorial alters the blockchain we connect to a testnet so we don’t create spam on the production server.\n\n2. User information and steem node \n\nWe require the private active key of the user in order for the transfer to be committed to the blockchain. This is why we are using a testnet. The values are supplied via the terminal/console before we initialise the steem class. There are some demo accounts available but we encourage you to create your own accounts on a testnet and create balances you can transfer; it’s good practice.\n\n#capture user information\nusername = input('Enter username: ') #demo account: demo01\nwif = input('Enter private ACTIVE key: ') #demo account: 5HxTntgeoLm4trnTz94YBsY6MpAap1qRVXEKsU5n1v2du1gAgVH\n\n#connect node and private active key\nclient = steem.Steem(nodes=['https://testnet.steem.vc'], keys=[wif])\n\n\n3. Check balance \n\nIn order to give the user enough information to make the transfer we check the current balance of both the available and savings funds of the account using the get_account function.\n\n#check for valid account and get account balance for STEEM and SBD\nuserinfo = client.get_account(username)\nif(userinfo is None) :\n    print('Oops.

Transfer type and amount \n\nThe user is given a choice on the type of transfer (transfer/withdraw) as well as the currency. The user can also elect to cancel the process entirely. If you are using one of Steemit’s demo accounts, please leave some funds for others to transfer! Once the user makes their choice we proceed to assign the amount as well as the asset parameter.\n\n#choice of transfer/withdrawal\ntitle1 = 'Please choose transfer type: '\noptions1 = ['Transfer', 'Withdrawal', 'Cancel']\n#get index and selected transfer type\ntransfer_type, index = pick(options1, title1)\n\nif transfer_type == 'Cancel':\n    print('Transaction cancelled')\n    exit()\n\n#choice of currency\ntitle2 = 'Please choose currency: '\noptions2 = ['STEEM', 'SBD']\noption, index = pick(options2, title2)\n\nif option == 'STEEM':\n    #get STEEM transfer amount\n    amount = input('Enter amount of STEEM to transfer: ')\n    asset = 'STEEM'\nelse:\n    #get SBD transfer amount\n    amount = input('Enter amount of SBD to transfer: ')\n    asset = 'SBD'\n\n\n5. Transfer commit \n\nOnce all the parameters have been assigned we can proceed with the actual commit to the blockchain. The relevant function is executed based on the selected choice the user made in the previous step.\n\nif transfer_type == 'Transfer':\n    #parameters: amount, asset, memo, to, account\n    client.transfer_to_savings(float(amount), asset, '', username, username)\n    print('\\n' + 'Transfer to savings balance successful')\nelse:\n    #create request ID random integer\n    requestID = random.randint(1,1000000)\n    #parameters: amount, asset, memo, request_id=None, to=None, account=None\n    client.transfer_from_savings(float(amount), asset, '', requestID, username, username)\n    print('\\n' + 'Withdrawal from savings successful, transaction ID: ' + str(requestID))\n\n\nWith a withdrawal, the method requires a unique identifier for the transaction to be completed. For this we create a random integer and also display it on the UI along with the result of the transaction. The memo parameter is optional and can be left empty as in the above example. We also use the source account for the to parameter. This can be replace by any other valid user account. A simple confirmation of the transfer is printed on the UI.\n\nAs an added confirmation we check the balance of the user again and display it on the UI. This is not required at all but it serves as a more definitive confirmation that the transfer has been completed correctly.\n\n#get remaining account balance for STEEM and SBD\nuserinfo = client.get_account(username)\ntotal_steem = userinfo['balance']\ntotal_sbd = userinfo['sbd_balance']\nsavings_steem = userinfo['savings_balance']\nsavings_sbd = userinfo['savings_sbd_balance']\n\nprint('\\n' + 'REMAINING ACCOUNT BALANCE:' + '\\n' + total_steem + '\\n' + total_sbd + '\\n')\nprint('CURRENT SAVINGS BALANCE:' + '\\n' + savings_steem + '\\n' + savings_sbd + '\\n')\n\n\nWe encourage users to play around with different values and data types to fully understand how this process works.

App setup \n\nIn this tutorial we are only using steem package - steem-python library.\n\n  # initialize Steem class\n  from steem import Steem\n\n  # defining private keys inside source code is not secure way but possible\n  s = Steem(keys=['&lt;private_posting_key&gt;', '&lt;private_active_key&gt;'])\n\n\nLast line from above snippet shows how to define private keys for account that’s going to transact using script.\n\n2. Key usage example \n\nAfter defining private keys inside Steem class, we can quickly sign any transaction and broadcast it to the network.\n\n  # above will allow accessing Commit methods such as\n  # demo account sending 0.001 STEEM to demo1 account\n\n  s.commit.transfer('demo','0.001','STEEM','memo text','demo1')\n\n\nAbove method works but it is not secure way of handling your keys because you have entered your keys within source code that you might leak accidentally. To avoid that, we can use CLI - command line interface steempy.\n\nYou can type following to learn more about steempy commands:\n\n  steempy -h\n\n\nsteempy lets you leverage your BIP38 encrypted wallet to perform various actions on your accounts.\n\nThe first time you use steempy, you will be prompted to enter a password. This password will be used to encrypt the steempy wallet, which contains your private keys.\n\nYou can import your Steem username with following command:\n\nsteempy importaccount username\n\nNext you can import individual private keys:\n\nsteempy addkey &lt;private_key&gt;\n\nThat’s it, now that your keys are securely stored on your local machine, you can easily sign transaction from any of your Python scripts by using defined keys.\n\n  # if private keys are not defined\n  # accessing Wallet methods are also possible and secure way\n  s.wallet.get_active_key_for_account('demo')\n\n\nAbove line fetches private key for user demo from local machine and signs transaction.\n\nsteempy also allows you to sign and broadcast transactions from terminal. For example:\n\nsteempy transfer --account &lt;account_name&gt; &lt;recipient_name&gt; 1 STEEM memo\n\nwould sign and broadcast transfer operation,\n\nsteempy upvote --account &lt;account_name&gt; link\n\nwould sing and broadcast vote operation, etc.\n\nThat’s it!\n\nTo Run the tutorial\n\n\n  review dev requirements\n  clone this repo\n  cd tutorials/001_using_keys_securely\n  pip install -r requirements.txt\n  python index.py\n  After a few moments, you should see output in terminal/command prompt screen."

The Steem python library has a built-in function to transmit transactions to the blockchain. We are using the vote method found within the commit class in the the library. Before we vote on content we first check whether the user has already voted. This is not strictly necessary as a voting operation overrides the previous vote value. We use the get_active_votes function to check for this. This function only requires two parameters, the author and the permlink for the comment/post that the query is for. This returns a list of the current voters for that comment. The vote function has 3 parameters:\n\n\n  identifier - This is a combination of the author and permink of the post/comment that the vote will be on\n  weight - This value determines whether the vote is an upvote (+100.0) or a downvote (-100.0) but this value cannot be 0\n  username - The name of the account that is executing the vote\n\n\nSteps\n\n\n  App setup - Library install and import. Connection to testnet\n  User information and steem node - Input user information and connection to Steem node\n  Check vote status - Vote status of post/comment\n  Commit vote - Commit vote to the blockchain\n\n\n1. App setup \n\nIn this tutorial we use 3 packages:\n\n\n  steem - steem-python library and interaction with Blockchain\n  pick - helps select the query type interactively\n\n\nWe import the libraries and connect to the testnet.\n\nimport steembase\nimport steem\nfrom pick import pick\n\nsteembase.chains.known_chains['STEEM'] = {\n    'chain_id': '79276aea5d4877d9a25892eaa01b0adf019d3e5cb12a97478df3298ccdd01673',\n    'prefix': 'STX', 'steem_symbol': 'STEEM', 'sbd_symbol': 'SBD', 'vests_symbol': 'VESTS'\n}\n\n\nBecause this tutorial alters the blockchain we connect to the testnet so we don’t create spam on the production server.\n\n2. User information and steem node\n\nWe also require the private posting key of the user that wishes to vote on the selected content so the action can be committed to the blockchain. This is why we have to specify this along with the testnet node. The values are supplied via the terminal/console before we initialise the steem class. We have supplied a test account, cdemo to use with this tutorial but any account set up on the testnet can be used.\n\n#capture user information\nusername = input('Please enter your username: ')\npostingkey = input('Please enter your private posting key: ')\n\n#connect node and private posting key, demo account name: cdemo, posting key: 5JEZ1EiUjFKfsKP32b15Y7jybjvHQPhnvCYZ9BW62H1LDUnMvHz\ns = steem.Steem(nodes=['https://testnet.steem.vc'], keys=[postingkey])\n\n\n3. Check vote status\n\nIn order to give the user an educated choice we first check whether they have already voted on the given post/comment. The author and permlink for the post is supplied via the console/terminal.\nIf you need to find something to vote on, you can try (https://condenser.steem.vc/) YMMV.\n\n#capture variables\nauthor = input('Author of post/comment that you wish to vote for: ')\npermlink = input('Permlink of the post/comment you wish to vote for: ')\n\n\nThe vote status check is done with a simple query to the blockchain.\n\n#check vote status\nresult = s.get_active_votes(author, permlink)\n\n\nThis query returns a list of the current voters on the specified post/comment. The result is checked against the username to determine what the current status is.\n\nif result:\n\tfor vote in result :\n\t\tif vote['voter'] == username:\n\t\t\ttitle = \"This post/comment has already been voted for\"\n\t\t\tbreak\n\t\telse:\n\t\t\ttitle = \"No vote for this post/comment has been submitted\"\nelse:\n\ttitle = \"No vote for this post/comment has been submitted\"\n\n\n4. Commit vote\n\nThe result from the previous step is used to give the user a choice in what the next step in the operation should be.\n\n#option to continue\noptions = ['Add/Change vote', 'Cancel voting process']\noption, index = pick(options, title)\n\n\nThe user is given a choice to either continue with the vote or cancel the operation. If the user elects to continue, the vote function is executed. The weight of the vote is input from the UI and the identifier parameter is created by combining the author and permlink values.\n\nIt’s important to note that the http client in steem-python will retry IF it sends an appbase query and detects a older, non-appbase error\n#voting commit\nif option == 'Add/Change vote':\n\tweight = input('\\n'+'Please advise weight of vote between -100.0 and 100 (not zero): ')\n\tidentifier = ('@'+author+'/'+permlink)\n\ttry:\n\t\tprint('Sending vote. ...')\n\t\ts.commit.vote(identifier, float(weight), username)\n\t\tprint('\\n'+'Vote sent.')\n\texcept (RPCErrorRecoverable, RPCError) as err: \n\t\tprint('\\n'+'Exception encountered. Unable to vote')\n\nelse:\n\tprint('Voting has been cancelled')\n\n\nWhen the function is executed the selected vote weight overrides any value previously recorded on the blockchain.\n\nA simple confirmation of the chosen action is printed on the screen.\n\nTo Run the tutorial\n\n\n  review dev requirements\n  clone this repo\n  cd tutorials/17_vote_on_content\n  pip install -r requirements.txt\n  python index.py\n  After a few moments, you should see a prompt for input in terminal screen."

We are using the approve_witness and disapprove_witness method found within the commit class in the library. We also use the get_active_witnesses function to query the blockchain for a list of available witnesses. Before we vote, we use the get_account function to check for all the witnesses that the user has currently voted for. This is not strictly necessary but adds to the useability of the process. The approve_witness method has 3 parameters:\n\n\n  witness - The witness to approve\n  account - The source user account for the voting\n  approve - This value is set to True when approving a witness\n\n\nThe disapprove_witness has the same parameters except for _approve_ which is not required.\n\nSteps\n\n\n  App setup - Library install and import.

User information and steem node \n\nWe require the private active key of the user in order for the transaction to be committed to the blockchain. This is why we are using a testnet. The values are supplied via the terminal/console before we initialise the steem class. We also check if the user name provided is active on the chain. There are some demo accounts available but we encourage you to create your own accounts on this testnet.\n\n#capture user information\nusername = input('Enter username: ') #demo account: cdemo\nwif = input('Enter private ACTIVE key: ') #demo account: 5KaNM84WWSqzwKzY82fXPaUW43idbLnPqf5SfjGxLfw6eV2kAP3\n\n#connect node and private active key\nclient = steem.Steem(nodes=['https://testnet.steem.vc'], keys=[wif])\n\n#check valid user\nuserinfo = client.get_account(username)\nif(userinfo is None) :\n    print('Oops.

Active witness list \n\nWe create a list of active witnesses so the user knows which witnesses are available to vote for. We do this by sending a query to the blockchain using the get_active_witnesses function. The result of this query is displayed on the UI.\n\n#print list of active witnesses\nprint('ACTIVE WITNESSES')\nwitness_list = client.get_active_witnesses()\npprint.pprint(witness_list)\n\n\nWe also provide the user with a list of witnesses that has already been voted for by their account. From this the user will know which witnesses can be removed, and which can be added to their set of approved witnesses. We generate this list using the get_account function and display it on the UI.\n\n#print list of currently voted for witnesses\nprint('\\n' + 'WITNESSES CURRENTLY VOTED FOR')\nvote_list = userinfo['witness_votes']\npprint.pprint(vote_list)\n\ninput('Press enter to continue')\n\n\n4. Vote / Unvote \n\nThe user is given the option to VOTE, UNVOTE or CANCEL the process. Depending on the choice the relevant function is executed. Both the VOTE and UNVOTE methods use the same input - the witness being added or removed. The different method executions are shown below.\n\n#choice of action\ntitle = ('Please choose action')\noptions = ['VOTE', 'UNVOTE', 'CANCEL']\noption, index = pick(options, title)\n\nif (option == 'CANCEL') :\n    print('\\n' + 'operation cancelled')\n    exit()\n\n\nVOTE :\n\nif (option == 'VOTE') :\n    # vote process\n    witness_vote = input('Please enter the witness name you wish to vote for: ')\n    if witness_vote not in witness_list :\n        print('\\n' + witness_vote + ' does not appear on the available witness list')\n        exit()\n    if witness_vote in vote_list :\n        print('\\n' + witness_vote + ' cannot be voted for more than once')\n        exit()\n    client.approve_witness(witness=witness_vote, account=username, approve=True)\n    print('\\n' + witness_vote + ' has been successfully voted for')\n\n\nUNVOTE :\n\nelse :\n    # unvote process\n    witness_unvote = input('Please enter the witness name you wish to remove the vote from: ')\n    if witness_unvote not in vote_list :\n        print('\\n' + witness_unvote + ' is not in your voted for list')\n        exit()\n    client.disapprove_witness(witness=witness_unvote, account=username)\n    print('\\n' + witness_unvote + ' has been removed from your voted for list')\n\n\nA confirmation of the transaction to the blockchain is displayed on the UI.\n\nWe encourage users to play around with different values and data types to fully understand how this process works.

We describe their use here.\n\n\n  Account creation method comparison\n  Discounted\n  Non-discounted\n\n\nAccount creation method comparison\n\n\n  \n    \n      Discounted account creations\n      Non-discounted account creations\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      You can purchase Account Creation Tokens(ACT) and use them to create an account. These tokens do not expire.\n      You need to create an account and wait for it to be approved by the Steemit faucet\n    \n    \n      Account’s are created immediately at no additional cost.\n      You are required to pay the 3 STEEM to create an account and wait for the account to be approved.\n    \n  \n\n\n1. Discounted account creations\n\nThe discounted account creation process uses an Account Creation Token(ACT) that is purchased with Resource Credits (RC) to create the account instead of paying the creation fee in STEEM.\n\nACTs are only good for creating accounts. They have no other purpose. They do not expire, are not transferable, and there is also no upper limit to the amount of tokens one can have. (If you’re a hoarder, you can be stockpile them.) There is however a limit on the total amount of tokens available on the blockchain for claiming at any one time. The available tokens replenish over time, and the limit is decided upon by the witnesses.\n\nClaiming tokens is the first step required to create an account. To do this, broadcast the claim_account operation on the network to claim an account token.\n\n[\n    \"claim_account\",\n    {\n        \"creator\": \"creator\",\n        \"fee\": \"0.000 STEEM\",\n        \"extensions\": []\n    }\n]\n\n\nOnce you have claimed a token, broadcast the create_claimed_account operation to create the account using the account that claimed the token. Select a new unique account name and provide account keys for the new account. These can be generated using any of the Steem libraries available.\n\n[\n    \"create_claimed_account\",\n    {\n        \"creator\": \"creator\",\n        \"new_account_name\": \"new_account_name\",\n        \"owner\": {\n            \"weight_threshold\": 1,\n            \"account_auths\": [],\n            \"key_auths\": [[\"000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\", 1]],\n        },\n        \"active\": {\n            \"weight_threshold\": 1,\n            \"account_auths\": [],\n            \"key_auths\": [[\"000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\", 1]],\n        },\n        \"posting\": {\n            \"weight_threshold\": 1,\n            \"account_auths\": [],\n            \"key_auths\": [[\"000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\", 1]],\n        },\n        \"memo_key\": {\n            \"weight_threshold\": 1,\n            \"account_auths\": [],\n            \"key_auths\": [[\"000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\", 1]],\n        },\n        \"json_metadata\": \"\",\n        \"extensions\": []\n    }\n]\n\n\nAccounts created with this method, don’t have any SP, but do have enough RC to interact with the chain at a starting level.\n\n2. Non-discounted account creation\n\nNon-discounted account creation operation allows you to create accounts by paying an account creation fee of 3 STEEM as part of the account creation api call. We use the account_create operation to commit this transaction to the blockchain. When creating a new account, the new account_name needs to be supplied. The keys must be derived from an owner-key which must be kept safe. The account keys can be generated using the new_account_name, owner-key and Steem tools.\n\n[\n    \"account_create\",\n    {\n        \"fee\": \"3.00 STEEM\",\n        \"creator\": \"creator\",\n        \"new_account_name\": \"new_account_name\",\n        \"owner\": {\n            \"weight_threshold\": 1,\n            \"account_auths\": [],\n            \"key_auths\": [[\"000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\", 1]],\n        },\n        \"active\": {\n            \"weight_threshold\": 1,\n            \"account_auths\": [],\n            \"key_auths\": [[\"000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\", 1]],\n        },\n        \"posting\": {\n            \"weight_threshold\": 1,\n            \"account_auths\": [],\n            \"key_auths\": [[\"000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\", 1]],\n        },\n        \"memo_key\": {\n            \"weight_threshold\": 1,\n            \"account_auths\": [],\n            \"key_auths\": [[\"000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\", 1]],\n        },\n        \"json_metadata\": \"\"\n    }\n]\n\n\nYou can follow this tutorial to see a working example of how to create accounts."

  							"content": "Since HF20 a Resource Credit (RC) system has been implemented to manage the number of transactions (comments, votes, transfers, etc) you can execute on the blockchain at any given time. This recipe will look at how to calculate your current RC and also what the current RC cost is for a given transaction. This recipe is far more ‘basics oriented’ than most. For a more in-depth description of how RC’s work consume this excellent RC demo created by Steemit’s Blockchain Team.\n\nIntro\n\nRCs are non-transferable credits that accrue to each Steem account based on how much Steem Power(SP) it has. An account spends RC when it transacts on the Steem blockchain. RCs regenerate over a 5 day period. If an account doesn’t have sufficient credits, the transaction will not be allowed to occur.\n\nThe price of a transaction (which consumes a particular resource, or resources) is based on the current stockpile of those resources. As a stockpile of a resource decreases, the RC cost of that resource increases. In other words, as the stockpile goes down, accounts will have to pay more RCs to use the remaining resources. This system disincentivize the over-consumption of resources by users as well as spam.\n\nThe RC system uses three measurements to determine how much a transaction should cost in terms of RCs: blockchain size, compute time, and state size. If an transaction is especially expensive in any one of these measurements, then performing that operation will be costly in terms of RCs. It is important to bear in mind that these are objective measurements of resource consumption at the blockchain level, so when something is expensive in RCs, all that means is that performing the action places a high burden on the network relative to other operations.\n\nThere are applications available to check an account’s status, like steemd.com, but here we will look at how calculate the values manually.\n\nCalculating available RC\n\nSince RC is calculated relative to SP, we first need to know the available SP before we can calculate how much RC we have left. The value of the current available mana(RC) is also accessible as a field from the getAccounts function.\n\n//capture account\nvar _account = await client.database.getAccounts(['username'])\nvar account = _account[0]\nvar props = await client.database.getDynamicGlobalProperties()\nvar CURRENT_UNIX_TIMESTAMP = parseInt((new Date(props.time).getTime() / 1000).toFixed(0))\n//calculate available SP\nvar totalShares = parseFloat(account.vesting_shares) + parseFloat(account.received_vesting_shares) - parseFloat(account.delegated_vesting_shares);\n//determine elapsed time since last RC update\nvar elapsed = CURRENT_UNIX_TIMESTAMP - account.voting_manabar.last_update_time;\nvar maxMana = totalShares * 1000000;\n//calculate current mana for the 5 day period (432000 sec = 5 days)\nvar currentMana = parseFloat(account.voting_manabar.current_mana) + elapsed * maxMana / 432000;\n\nif (currentMana &gt; maxMana) {\n    currentMana = maxMana;\n}\n//determine percentage of available mana(RC)\nvar currentManaPerc = currentMana * 100 / maxMana;\n    \nconsole.log(currentManaPerc);\n\n\nCalculating transaction cost\n\nA community created library, beem-python offers a solution to calculate the RC costs for a different transaction types. The three main transaction types are: posts/comments, transfers, and vote(on posts). The beem’s functions can be executed with no parameters (as seen below) to provide a rough estimate of an average operation.\n\nimport beem\nfrom beem.rc import RC\n\nclient = beem.Steem()\n\nrc = RC(steem_instance=client)\n#beem sets its own rough, default values if you don't pass them in.\nprint(rc.comment()) #(self, tx_size=1000, permlink_length=10, parent_permlink_length=10)\nprint(rc.vote()) #(self, tx_size=210)\nprint(rc.transfer()) #(self, tx_size=290, market_op_count=1)\n\n\nThe functions can also be executed for a specific transaction by passing in data for transaction in question. The first step is to calculate the transfer size of the operation which is then used to execute the function to calculate the RC costs.\n\nopdata = {\n    'voter': 'steemit',\n    'author': 'r1s2g3',\n    'permlink': 'rc-calculations-according-to-your-need-part-1',\n    'weight': 100\n}\n#create operation to check\nop = beembase.operations.Vote(opdata)\n#check vote transaction size\nvote_tx = rc.get_tx_size(op)\nprint(vote_tx)\n#check vote RC cost\nprint(rc.vote(vote_tx))\n\n\nYou can find the source for beem’s RC class in the beem github repo\nAdditional info can also be found in this article by steem user @holger80\n\nAllocation of RC to blockchain resources\n\nAn in depth look at how RC’s are assigned to each of the three resources (CPU megacycles/state memory/history size) can be found in Steemit’s wiki articles for RC Bandwidth System and Parameters"

Reward fund, recent claims, account’s total vests, rate of the sbd, voting power and weight of the vote. It is quite useful information for users to see and estimate. All of the data is possible to get via available APIs.\n\nSteps\n\n\n  Get Reward Fund Current reward fund information is crucial part of estimation\n  Get Account Steem power and voting power is another important info\n  Feed history To get price rate reported by witnesses\n  Final calculation Formulate all information we have\n\n\n1. Get Reward Fund\n\nGetting Reward Fund information is simply calling get_reward_fund('post') api call, it will give us reward_balance and recent_claims.\n\nThe response we’re working with will look like:\n\n{\n\t\"id\":0,\n\t\"name\":\"post\",\n\t\"reward_balance\":\"741222.051 STEEM\",\n\t\"recent_claims\":\"457419472820935017\",\n\t\"last_update\":\"2018-05-23T12:08:36\",\n\t\"content_constant\":\"2000000000000\",\n\t\"percent_curation_rewards\":2500,\n\t\"percent_content_rewards\":10000,\n\t\"author_reward_curve\":\"linear\",\n\t\"curation_reward_curve\":\"square_root\"\n}\n\n\n2. Get Account\n\nNext we will need total vests held by account, get_accounts api call returns account data, which will hold vesting_shares, received_vesting_shares, delegated_vesting_shares. It also returns current voting_power information.\n\nThe response example will look like:\n\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": 9660,\n    \"name\": \"steemitblog\",\n    \"owner\": {\n      \"weight_threshold\": 1,\n      \"account_auths\": [\n        [\n          \"ned\",\n          1\n        ]\n      ],\n      \"key_auths\": [\n        [\n          \"STM65wH1LZ7BfSHcK69SShnqCAH5xdoSZpGkUjmzHJ5GCuxEK9V5G\",\n          1\n        ]\n      ]\n    },\n    \"active\": {\n      \"weight_threshold\": 1,\n      \"account_auths\": [],\n      \"key_auths\": [\n        [\n          \"STM65wH1LZ7BfSHcK69SShnqCAH5xdoSZpGkUjmzHJ5GCuxEK9V5G\",\n          1\n        ]\n      ]\n    },\n    \"posting\": {\n      \"weight_threshold\": 1,\n      \"account_auths\": [\n        [\n          \"ned\",\n          1\n        ]\n      ],\n      \"key_auths\": [\n        [\n          \"STM4yfYEjUoey4PLrKhnKFo1XKQZtZ77fWLnbGTr2mAUaSt2Sx9W4\",\n          1\n        ],\n        [\n          \"STM5FeHFtL8J453DUi98LKwkqXBH5iwxf9xCqYs6QwPibPru3RNq3\",\n          1\n        ],\n        [\n          \"STM5VwLXkNQf17sQ2XuxScdxruwBy1jak2mDxCjmyfYMNhm1WzPzN\",\n          1\n        ],\n        [\n          \"STM5ke2kzgwBmysSqCNM6zRABi8SNpaJEtnFXuTtRcU3Uvf47481z\",\n          1\n        ]\n      ]\n    },\n    \"memo_key\": \"STM5FeHFtL8J453DUi98LKwkqXBH5iwxf9xCqYs6QwPibPru3RNq3\",\n    \"json_metadata\": \"\",\n    \"proxy\": \"\",\n    \"last_owner_update\": \"2017-03-17T18:19:18\",\n    \"last_account_update\": \"2017-03-17T18:19:18\",\n    \"created\": \"2016-05-24T18:54:24\",\n    \"mined\": false,\n    \"recovery_account\": \"steem\",\n    \"last_account_recovery\": \"2016-07-19T19:48:54\",\n    \"reset_account\": \"null\",\n    \"comment_count\": 0,\n    \"lifetime_vote_count\": 0,\n    \"post_count\": 154,\n    \"can_vote\": true,\n    \"voting_power\": 9800,\n    \"last_vote_time\": \"2018-05-22T20:10:45\",\n    \"balance\": \"810.371 STEEM\",\n    \"savings_balance\": \"0.000 STEEM\",\n    \"sbd_balance\": \"4613.426 SBD\",\n    \"sbd_seconds\": \"10828300402329\",\n    \"sbd_seconds_last_update\": \"2018-05-22T22:34:24\",\n    \"sbd_last_interest_payment\": \"2018-04-25T18:26:15\",\n    \"savings_sbd_balance\": \"0.000 SBD\",\n    \"savings_sbd_seconds\": \"0\",\n    \"savings_sbd_seconds_last_update\": \"1970-01-01T00:00:00\",\n    \"savings_sbd_last_interest_payment\": \"1970-01-01T00:00:00\",\n    \"savings_withdraw_requests\": 0,\n    \"reward_sbd_balance\": \"79.490 SBD\",\n    \"reward_steem_balance\": \"0.000 STEEM\",\n    \"reward_vesting_balance\": \"608341.169185 VESTS\",\n    \"reward_vesting_steem\": \"293.101 STEEM\",\n    \"vesting_shares\": \"93540695.469156 VESTS\",\n    \"delegated_vesting_shares\": \"0.000000 VESTS\",\n    \"received_vesting_shares\": \"0.000000 VESTS\",\n    \"vesting_withdraw_rate\": \"0.000000 VESTS\",\n    \"next_vesting_withdrawal\": \"1969-12-31T23:59:59\",\n    \"withdrawn\": 0,\n    \"to_withdraw\": 0,\n    \"withdraw_routes\": 0,\n    \"curation_rewards\": 10288,\n    \"posting_rewards\": 38917298,\n    \"proxied_vsf_votes\": [\n      0,\n      0,\n      0,\n      0\n    ],\n    \"witnesses_voted_for\": 0,\n    \"last_post\": \"2018-05-22T18:59:33\",\n    \"last_root_post\": \"2018-05-22T18:59:33\",\n    \"average_bandwidth\": \"34722906781\",\n    \"lifetime_bandwidth\": \"656153000000\",\n    \"last_bandwidth_update\": \"2018-05-22T20:10:45\",\n    \"average_market_bandwidth\": 1170000000,\n    \"lifetime_market_bandwidth\": 1170000000,\n    \"last_market_bandwidth_update\": \"2016-07-27T15:10:09\",\n    \"vesting_balance\": \"0.000 STEEM\",\n    \"reputation\": \"146151592482665\",\n    \"transfer_history\": [],\n    \"market_history\": [],\n    \"post_history\": [],\n    \"vote_history\": [],\n    \"other_history\": [],\n    \"witness_votes\": [],\n    \"tags_usage\": [],\n    \"guest_bloggers\": []\n  }\n]\n\n\n3.

Also see: RC Bandwidth System, 0.20.2 Release Notes, Developer Guide: Resource Credit System\n\n\nWe’re going over the various API calls needed to determine the remaining bandwidth available to a particular account.  As mentioned in the STEEM Whitepaper:\n\n\n  Bandwidth used by an individual user should be measured over a suitably long period of time to allow that\nuser to time-shift their usage. Users tend to login, do many things at once, then logout. This means that\ntheir bandwidth over a short period of time may appear much higher than if viewed over a longer period of\ntime. If the time window is stretched too far, then the reserve ratio will not adjust fast enough to respond\nto short-term surges; conversely, if the window is too short then clustering usage will have too big of an\nimpact on normal users.\n\n\nBandwidth is specific to each account and depends on account activity.\n\nSections\n\n\n  Getting Account Bandwidth\n  Dynamic Global Properties\n  Account STEEM Power\n  Calculate\n\n\nGetting Account Bandwidth\n\ncurl -s --data '{\n   \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\n   \"method\":\"condenser_api.get_account_bandwidth\",\n   \"params\":[\n      \"cheetah\",\n      \"forum\"\n   ],\n   \"id\":1\n}' https://api.steemit.com\n\n\n{\n   \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\n   \"result\":{\n      \"id\":20846,\n      \"account\":\"cheetah\",\n      \"type\":\"forum\",\n      \"average_bandwidth\":\"7525646416619\",\n      \"lifetime_bandwidth\":\"386010589000000\",\n      \"last_bandwidth_update\":\"2018-07-18T16:37:54\"\n   },\n   \"id\":1\n}\n\n\nIn this example, we got forum (blogging) average bandwidth of 7,525,646,416,619 with a lifetime bandwidth of 386,010,589,000,000.\n\nNote, average_bandwidth is expressed as an integer with six decimal places represented.

  							"content": "When you are sending STEEM or SBD to another account, when you are writing a post or a comment, or when you are voting or downvoting a post, you are broadcasting transactions into the Steem blockchain. In other words, any action you take on Steem blockchain is a transaction.\n\nWhat makes transactions so special?\nA transaction needs to be signed by the account owner and verified by the blockchain before including in the blocks. Without a signature, the transaction will be rejected by the blockchain.\n\nYou may ask “why signing? isn’t there another way?”\nWithout using signatures, blockchain needs a way to authenticate users before broadcasting transactions. And for authenticating users, there must be a key included in the request that sent to the blockchain.\n\nAs you know, sending keys over to a server that claims to be a blockchain node is risky. Since anyone can run a blockchain node and capture keys. Of course, we can’t trust the blockchain that lacks security.\n\nWith the help of encryption, we can sign transactions on our own hardware and send signed transactions securely to any server. A signed transaction doesn’t include any key. Just a signature that proves the transaction is coming from the account owner.\n\nHow to broadcast transactions?\nBroadcasting a transaction is pretty easy.\nBut before broadcasting, the transaction must be signed.\nAnd for signing a transaction, the transaction must be serialized.\n\nAvailable documents:\n\n  Steem transaction signing in a nutshell by @xeroc (3 years ago - Python)\n\n\nI couldn’t find anything else.\n\nAvailable libraries(JS):\n\n  steem-js\n  dsteem\n  steem-tx\n\n\nsteem-js and dsteem both are working in most cases.\nBut I couldn’t use steem-js nor dsteem on the Nativescript environment (framework for Android and IOS applications). So I created Steem-TX. A complete but light library. Steem-TX should work in almost every situation.\n\nI will explain things that are not available directly anywhere else. If you don’t understand any part, just comment below. (or maybe google it 🤷)\n\n\nStep 1\nCreating Transaction:\nAs you know, a transaction consists of 6 variables inside an object:\nconst transaction = {\n  ref_block_num: Number,\n  ref_block_prefix: Number,\n  expiration: Date,\n  operations: Array,\n  extensions: Array,\n  signatures: Array\n}\n\n\nWe will fill this object by the end of the post.\n\n@xeroc explained most of the properties. Check this post for explanation of variables.\n\nDefining 4 of 6 needed variables:\nconst props = getDynamicGlobalProperties()\nconst refBlockNum = props.head_block_number &amp; 0xffff\nconst refBlockPrefix = Buffer.from(props.head_block_id, 'hex').readUInt32LE(4)\nconst expireTime = 1000 * 60\nconst expiration = new Date(Date.now() + expireTime)\n    .toISOString()\n    .slice(0, -5)\nconst extensions = []\n\n\nWithout operations, there is no transaction!\nYou can include one or more operations in this array. Check Devportal for list of all available operations.\nconst operations = [\n  [\n    'vote',\n    {\n      voter: 'guest123',\n      author: 'guest123',\n      permlink: '20191107t125713486z-post',\n      weight: 9900\n    }\n  ]\n]\n\nTransaction is created:\n\nconst transaction = {\n  ref_block_num: refBlockNum,\n  ref_block_prefix: refBlockPrefix,\n  expiration,\n  operations,\n  extensions\n}\n\nThe only missing part is signatures\n\n\nStep 2\nSerializing transaction:\n\nCreate a new ByteBuffer:\nconst ByteBuffer = require('bytebuffer')\nconst buffer = new ByteBuffer(\n    ByteBuffer.DEFAULT_CAPACITY,\n    ByteBuffer.LITTLE_ENDIAN\n  )\n\nEvery variable should be serialized according to the data type of its value.\n\nWe will use the following serialization for transaction object:\n\n\n  ref_block_num =&gt; UInt16 (16bit unsigned integer)\n  ref_block_prefix &amp; expiration =&gt; UInt32 (32bit unsigned integer)\n  operations: \nvoter &amp; author &amp; permlink =&gt; VString (varint32 prefixed UTF8 encoded string)\nweight =&gt; Int16 (16bit signed integer)\n  extensions =&gt; VString\n\n\nAlso, you need operation_id of operation. operation_id is the position of the operation defined in the Steem blockchain. Here is the list of operations on the Steem blockchain.\nvote_operation: 0\ncomment_operation: 1\ntransfer_operation: 2\n...\n\n\nThe code:\nbuffer.writeUInt16(refBlockNum)\nbuffer.writeUInt32(refBlockPrefix)\nbuffer.writeUInt32(expiration)\nbuffer.writeVarint32(operations.length) // number of operations\nbuffer.writeVarint32(0) // operation id\nbuffer.writeVString(voter)\nbuffer.writeVString(author)\nbuffer.writeVString(permlink)\nbuffer.writeInt16(weight)\nbuffer.writeVarint32(extensions.length) // number of extensions\n// in case of any extensions\n// buffer.writeVString(extensions[0])\n\n\nThe serialized transaction is ready.\n\n\nStep 3\nCreate Digest from Transaction:\n\nFirst, convert byte buffer to the actual buffer:\nbuffer.flip() // set offset = 0\nconst transactionData = Buffer.from(buffer.toBuffer())\n\nCreate SHA256 hash of transactionData and chain id (digest):\nconst chainId = '0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000'\nconst CHAIN_ID = Buffer.from(chainId, 'hex')\n\nconst input = Buffer.concat([CHAIN_ID, transactionData])\n\nYou have 2 options here:\n\n  crypto-js\n    const CryptoJS = require('crypto-js')\nconst wa = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.create(input)\nconst digest = Buffer.from(\n  CryptoJS.SHA256(wa).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Hex),\n  'hex'\n)\n    \n  \n  crypto\n    const crypto = require('crypto')\nconst digest = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(input).digest()\n    \n    USE ONLY ONE OF ABOVE (crypto-js or crypto)\n  \n\n\nI used crypto-js in Steem-TX but you can use whichever that works for you. The code for crypto is also commented out in Steem-TX which can be easily replaced with crypto-js.\n\nNow prepare private key:\nconst bs58 = require('bs58')\nconst key = '5JRaypasxMx1L97ZUX7YuC5Psb5EAbF821kkAGtBj7xCJFQcbLg'\nconst keyBuffer = bs58.decode(key)\nconst privateKey = keyBuffer.slice(0, -4).slice(1)\n\n\nWith digest and private key, we can finally sign the transaction.\n\n\nStep 4\nSign the Transaction:\n\nWe will use this function in the signing process to verify the signature:\nconst isCanonicalSignature = signature =&gt; {\n  return (\n    !(signature[0] &amp; 0x80) &amp;&amp;\n    !(signature[0] === 0 &amp;&amp; !(signature[1] &amp; 0x80)) &amp;&amp;\n    !(signature[32] &amp; 0x80) &amp;&amp;\n    !(signature[32] === 0 &amp;&amp; !(signature[33] &amp; 0x80))\n  )\n}\n\n\nWe can sign the transaction with more than one key in the case of multi-signature accounts. Just repeat the process of signing for the signedTransaction.\n\nconst signedTransaction = { ...transaction } // copy transaction object\nif (!signedTransaction.signatures) {\n  signedTransaction.signatures = []\n}\n\n// repeat for multi-signature accounts\nconst secp256k1 = require('secp256k1')\nlet rv = {}\nlet attempts = 0\ndo {\n  const input = Buffer.concat([digest, Buffer.alloc(1, ++attempts)])\n  const wa = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.create(input)\n  const options = {\n    data: Buffer.from(\n      CryptoJS.SHA256(wa).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Hex),\n      'hex'\n    )\n  }\n  rv = secp256k1.sign(digest, privateKey, options)\n} while (!isCanonicalSignature(rv.signature))\nconst signature = {signature: rv.signature, recovery: rv.recovery}\n\n\nFinally, the transaction is signed!\nBut, we must convert the signature into the string and include in the transaction object:\n\nconst sigBuffer = Buffer.alloc(65)\nsigBuffer.writeUInt8(signature.recovery + 31, 0)\nsignature.signature.copy(buffer, 1)\nconst stringSignature = sigBuffer.toString('hex')\nsignedTransaction.signatures.push(stringSignature)\n\nThe end.\n\nStep 5\nBroadcast the Transaction:\nsignedTransaction is ready to be broadcasted into the blockchain using Condenser Api and broadcast_transaction_synchronous method.\n\nIf you understand all the steps from 1 to 4, I think you should know how to make a post-call to a Steem node and broadcast the transaction. In case you don’t, check Devportal\n\nYou can use any library. I used axios to broadcast transaction:\nconst axios = require('axios')\nconst node = 'https://api.steemit.com'\nconst call = async (method, params = []) =&gt; {\n  const res = await axios.post(\n    node,\n    JSON.stringify({\n      jsonrpc: '2.0',\n      method,\n      params,\n      id: 1\n    })\n  )\n  if (res &amp;&amp; res.statusText === 'OK') {\n    return res.data\n  }\n}\n\nconst result = await call('condenser_api.broadcast_transaction_synchronous', [\n  signedTransaction\n])\nconsole.log(result)\n\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nAfter reading or writing this code you will appreciate the software that is doing all this process behind the scene when you are clicking on the upvote button.\n\nYou don’t have to write this code from scratch. Steem-TX is already coded in the same way. See the announcement post.\n\nFeel free to test, use, and share. With the hope for better Steem!\n\nYour witness, @mahdiyari\n\n\n\nImage source: pixabay.com\n\n\n\n  See: How to serialize and sign Steem transactions using Javascript (without Steem Javascript libraries)\n  by\n  @mahdiyari"

  							"content": "By the end of this recipe you should know how to install jussi on your local subnet to take advantage of its features.\n\nThis recipe will take you through the process of setting up jussi for a small infrastructure like a home network.\n\nIntro\n\nWhat is a Multiplexer?  In this context, a multiplexer an appliance that accepts API requests from multiple applications running on the same subnet and passes them to an upstream node.  This means, for example, if you have two applications that request the same block from API, your local jussi instance will make a single upstream request for the block and return it to both applications.\n\nDeploying jussi on your own local subnet will help improve efficiency because your local applications won’t require SSL and jussi can take care of gzipping requests that go out over the Internet.\n\n\n  \n\n\nSteps\n\n\n  Setting Up Docker In order to run jussi, docker is recommended\n  Install jussi Clone jussi from the repository and build\n  Configure Your Apps Point all of your applications to this node\n\n\n1. Setting Up Docker \n\nAlthough it’s possible to set up jussi to run natively without virtualization, docker is recommended.  Setting up docker depends on your operating system:\n\n\n  Docker for Linux\n  Docker for macOS\n  Docker for Windows\n\n\n2. Install jussi \n\ngit clone https://github.com/steemit/jussi.git\ncd jussi\n\n\nEdit the file DEV_config.json and change all:\n\nhttps://steemd.steemitdev.com\n\n… to …\n\nhttps://api.steemit.com\n\nAlso consider adding the retries element to your DEV_config.json.\n\nThen build and run:\n\ndocker build -t=\"$USER/jussi:$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)\" .\ndocker run -itp 9000:8080 \"$USER/jussi:$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)\"\n\n\n3. Configure Your Apps \n\nNow, you can use your new jussi node as if it’s a full node running locally.  For example:\n\ncurl -s --data '{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\", \"method\":\"condenser_api.get_block\", \"params\":[8675309], \"id\":1}' http://localhost:9000\n\n\nIn this case, http://localhost:9000 will act like a full node.  In reality, it’s passing all of its request to its upstream, https://api.steemit.com.\n\nOnce you’ve implemented your own jussi node in this manner, you should notice an improvement in bandwidth utilization.  If you’re internet provider implements packet shaping strategies, this will have a positive impact because you are no longer streaming the entire blockchain once for each application.\n\nTroubleshooting / Updating\n\nError: invalid argument \"/jussi:master\" for t=/jussi:master: invalid reference format\n\nSolution:\n\nYou’re probably trying to run on a raspberry pi.  Just replace $USER in the command with the current user.\n\n\n\nIf you would like to update jussi to the latest version, here’s a quick way:\n\ngit stash &amp;&amp; git pull &amp;&amp; git stash pop\n\n\nIf there are git errors due to structural changes to DEV_config.json, just start over from step 2 and reclone jussi to a fresh location.  Otherwise, you should be able to rebuild and run."

  							"content": "Without MIRA, the requirement of RAM to run a steemd node will grow indefinitely which is clearly unsustainable. To extend our runway into the distant future, MIRA-enabled nodes will primarily be used. MIRA is based on RocksDB technology which is highly configurable and somewhat complex. MIRA will behave differently on different pieces of hardware so it is virtually impossible to create a “one-size fits all” configuration; therefore it is important to provide a way for users to get the most performance from their particular hardware. This guide aims to do just that. This guide should be kept up-to-date and improved within the steemd repository for documentation purposes. Improvements should be made in to a pull request against MIRA Tuning Guide.\n\n\n\nPreface\n\nAfter MIRAs initial development efforts we released the Basic MIRA Configuration Guide to help bootstrap users attempting to use MIRA enabled steemd. There is actually much more fine tuning that can be done to improve MIRA’s performance and I’d like to take the time now to share it with the community. We will break up this process into three phases:\n\n\n  Phase 1: Gathering statistics\n  Phase 2: Analyzing statistics\n  Phase 3: Applying performance recommendations\n\n\nPhase 1: Gathering statistics\n\nAs you may have noticed, within the database.cfg file, there is a global option called statistics. By default this is set to false. This must be set to true before proceeding! Here is an example of a database.cfg with statistics enabled:\n\n$ cat ~/.steemd/database.cfg \n{\n  \"global\": {\n    \"shared_cache\": {\n      \"capacity\": \"5368709120\"\n    },\n    \"write_buffer_manager\": {\n      \"write_buffer_size\": \"1073741824\"\n    },\n    \"object_count\": 62500,\n    \"statistics\": true\n  },\n  \"base\": {\n    \"optimize_level_style_compaction\": true,\n    \"increase_parallelism\": true,\n    \"block_based_table_options\": {\n      \"block_size\": 8192,\n      \"cache_index_and_filter_blocks\": true,\n      \"bloom_filter_policy\": {\n        \"bits_per_key\": 10,\n        \"use_block_based_builder\": false\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nOnce statistics has been enabled, simply perform the action you’d like to optimize. In my example, I will be syncing up the testnet. Start steemd like you otherwise normally would. Please be aware that enabling statistics causes a drastic performance impact - you won’t want to run this in production. By default, statistics are dumped every 10 minutes so you will want to run for a while. The more data you gather, the more accurate the performance tuning suggestions will potentially be.\n\nPhase 2: Analyzing statistics\n\nLuckily, you won’t need intimate knowledge of RocksDB in order to analyze the statistics data. The developers working on RocksDB have provided us with a tool that can read the gathered statistics and make performance tuning recommendations. This tool can be found within the steemd repository at programs/util/rocksdb_advisor.sh. From the program/util directory run the tool:\n\n$ sh rocksdb_advisor.sh\n\n\n\nIf all goes well, you should get output for each object specified in the rocksdb_advisor.sh file. Here is an example of the possible output:\n\nAdvisor for account_authority...\nWARNING(TimeSeriesData) check_and_trigger: float division by zero\n\nRule: bloom-not-enabled\nTimeSeriesCondition: bloom-not-enabled statistics: ['[]rocksdb.bloom.filter.useful.count', '[]rocksdb.bloom.filter.full.positive.count', '[]rocksdb.bloom.filter.full.true.positive.count'] behavior: evaluate_expression expression: keys[0]+keys[1]+keys[2]==0 aggregation_op: avg trigger: {'ENTITY_PLACEHOLDER': [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]}\nSuggestion: inc-bloom-bits-per-key option : bloom_bits action : increase suggested_values : ['2']\nscope: entities:\n{'ENTITY_PLACEHOLDER'}\nscope: col_fam:\n{'boost\\\\:\\\\:mpl\\\\:\\\\:v_item&lt;steem\\\\:\\\\:chain\\\\:\\\\:by_id, boost\\\\:\\\\:mpl\\\\:\\\\:vector0&lt;mpl_\\\\:\\\\:na&gt;, 0&gt;', 'boost\\\\:\\\\:mpl\\\\:\\\\:v_item&lt;steem\\\\:\\\\:chain\\\\:\\\\:by_last_owner_update, boost\\\\:\\\\:mpl\\\\:\\\\:vector0&lt;mpl_\\\\:\\\\:na&gt;, 0&gt;', 'boost\\\\:\\\\:mpl\\\\:\\\\:v_item&lt;steem\\\\:\\\\:chain\\\\:\\\\:by_account, boost\\\\:\\\\:mpl\\\\:\\\\:vector0&lt;mpl_\\\\:\\\\:na&gt;, 0&gt;', 'default'}\n\n\nIn reality you will get significantly more output than above. For the sake of simplicity, we will work with one performance suggestion. We can see here the rocksdb_advisor.sh provided a suggestion for the account_authority_object database.\n\n\n  Suggestion: inc-bloom-bits-per-key option : bloom_bits action : increase suggested_values : [‘2’]\n\n\nLet’s move on to applying the advisor’s suggestions.\n\nPhase 3: Applying performance recommendations\n\nIf you want to apply the same options to all databases, you would just change the base setting as this is applied to every database within a MIRA enabled steemd node.\n\nYou may notice that you will get different recommendations for different objects. In MIRA’s implementation, each object is its own RocksDB database. How do we implement different options for different databases?\n\nConfiguration overlays\n\nA configuration overlay is a set of options overriding the base configuration to be applied to a specified database. In our default configuration, you may notice that one of the objects is called base. These settings are applied to every database unless a configuration overlay overrides them. A configuration overlay takes the same options as base. As an example, we will override bits_per_key for the account_authority_object.\n\n{\n  \"global\": {\n    \"shared_cache\": {\n      \"capacity\": \"5368709120\"\n    },\n    \"write_buffer_manager\": {\n      \"write_buffer_size\": \"1073741824\"\n    },\n    \"object_count\": 62500,\n    \"statistics\": true\n  },\n  \"base\": {\n    \"optimize_level_style_compaction\": true,\n    \"increase_parallelism\": true,\n    \"block_based_table_options\": {\n      \"block_size\": 8192,\n      \"cache_index_and_filter_blocks\": true,\n      \"bloom_filter_policy\": {\n        \"bits_per_key\": 10,\n        \"use_block_based_builder\": false\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"account_authority_object\": {\n    \"block_based_table_options\": {\n      \"block_size\": 8192,\n      \"cache_index_and_filter_blocks\": true,\n      \"bloom_filter_policy\": {\n        \"bits_per_key\": 12,\n        \"use_block_based_builder\": false\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n  Note: When overriding a configuration value, you must override the complete first level option (such as block_based_table_options in the above example).\n\n\nEven though we did not specify optimize_level_style_compaction and increase_parallelism to the account_authority_object configuration, they are inherited from base.\n\nAvailable options\n\nNot every RocksDB option is made available to MIRA configurations. It is very possible that the RocksDB tool can recommend changing an option that is unavailable through MIRA. Feel free to add it and create a pull request, especially if it is improving your nodes performance. You can see a complete list of available options in the codebase in libraries/mira/src/configuration.cpp. View the recommended options and check the list; I tried to preserve the naming conventions during implementation to make this process easier.\n\nConclusion\n\nYou may need to repeat this process to achieve optimal results. There is no guarantee that you will see performance improvements as this is experimental in nature. When you are benchmarking your configuration or you have completed your performance tuning, remember to set statistics to false.\n\nHappy performance tuning and good luck!\n\n\n\n  See: MIRA: Performance Tuning\n  by\n  @gerbino"

  							"content": "Intro\n\nTypically, the initial request from API calls will be sufficient for showing what’s happening in the blockchain right now.  But often, it is desirable to reach further back in time.\n\nFor web-based applications, it is ideal to show the initial page of results, followed by older results as needed.\n\nThe purpose of pagination is to limit the time it takes to return the most relevant results, making each page of results easier to handle.\n\nThe typical maximum result for one page of results is 1,000 objects (with some exceptions).\n\nNote: For these examples, we are going to use a command-line JSON processor called jq to interpret JSON results.\n\napt-get install jq\n\n\nInstead of jq, you could also pipe to python -mjson.tool, as an alternative.\n\nLimit\n\nHere, we are setting a limit of 10:\n\ncurl -s --data '{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"method\": \"database_api.list_votes\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"start\": [\"\", \"\", \"\"],\n    \"limit\": 10,\n    \"order\": \"by_comment_voter\"\n  },\n  \"id\": 1\n}' https://api.steemit.com | jq\n\n\nStart (primarily database_api.list_*)\n\nExtending the previous example, if we wanted to get the next page of results, we can provide values in start by using the last result of our previous request:\n\ncurl -s --data '{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"method\": \"database_api.list_votes\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"start\": [\"steemit\", \"firstpost\", \"red\"],\n    \"limit\": 10,\n    \"order\": \"by_comment_voter\"\n  },\n  \"id\": 1\n}' https://api.steemit.com | jq\n\n\nUsing this pattern, it is possible to get the entire list of votes, given enough time.\n\nOrder (primarily database_api.list_*)\n\nExtending the previous example, the order of results declares the structure of start.  So if we request order of by_comment_voter, then start must be author, permlink, voter.\n\nBut if we change the order to by_voter_comment, then start must be voter, author, permlink:\n\ncurl -s --data '{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"method\": \"database_api.list_votes\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"start\": [\"red\", \"steemit\", \"firstpost\"],\n    \"limit\": 10,\n    \"order\": \"by_comment_voter\"\n  },\n  \"id\": 1\n}' https://api.steemit.com | jq\n\n\nUsing by_comment_voter sorts by the author/permlink, then the voter, so the start param consists of author, permlink, voter.\n\nThe author value is the author of the comment, permlink value is the permlink of the comment, and voter value is the voter to start listing from.  For example, [\"steemit\", \"firstpost\", \"\"] will list, in order, the vote objects on the steemit/firstpost post, starting from the beginning since we did not supply a voter in the start param.\n\nOn the other hand, by_voter_comment returns the votes a particular voter cast, starting from the provided permlink\n, thus the start param requires voter, author, permlink.  For example, [\"red\", \"\", \"\"], will list, in order, the vote objects cast by voter red and will start from the beginning because no author/permlink was provided.  The results will be every single vote object associated with either the comment or the voter.\n\nIf you want only the votes cast by, for example, steemit since the last vote on steemit/firstpost then use, [\"steemit\", \"steemit\", \"firstpost\"] with order by_voter_comment.\n\nSections\n\nThe following methods have various forms of pagination:\n\n\n  account_history_api\n    \n      get_account_history\n    \n  \n  database_api\n    \n      list_accounts\n      list_change_recovery_account_requests\n      list_comments\n      list_decline_voting_rights_requests\n      list_escrows\n      list_limit_orders\n      list_owner_histories\n      list_savings_withdrawals\n      list_sbd_conversion_requests\n      list_vesting_delegation_expirations\n      list_vesting_delegations\n      list_votes\n      list_withdraw_vesting_routes\n      list_witness_votes\n      list_witnesses\n      list_proposal_votes\n      list_proposals\n      list_smt_contributions\n      list_smt_token_emissions\n      list_smt_tokens\n    \n  \n  follow_api\n    \n      get_account_reputations\n      get_blog\n      get_blog_entries\n      get_feed\n      get_feed_entries\n      get_followers\n      get_following\n    \n  \n  reputation_api\n    \n      get_account_reputations\n    \n  \n  tags_api\n    \n      get_discussions_by_author_before_date\n      get_replies_by_last_update\n      get_trending_tags\n    \n  \n  condenser_api\n    \n      get_account_history\n      get_blog\n      get_blog_entries\n      get_discussions_by_author_before_date\n      get_feed\n      get_feed_entries\n      get_followers\n      get_following\n      get_replies_by_last_update\n      get_vesting_delegations\n      get_trending_tags\n    \n  \n\n\naccount_history_api.get_account_history\n\nAlthough the name of the param is start, it’s better to think of it as from.

  							"content": "Intro\n\nRunning a testnet is ideal for application developers who want to verify their app without broadcasting signed transactions over the mainnet.  It’s also a great way for blockchain developers to verify changes to the blockchain and can allow witnesses to get a preview of changes that they are expected to approve.\n\nSetting up a testnet can be as simple as running a single Docker command, such as:\n\ndocker run -d -P inertia/tintoy:latest\n\n\nThis docker command is useful for rapid testnet deploy because it only creates 2,000 accounts.\n\nBut in this tutorial, we will go over the no docker approach which will create all accounts that exist on mainnet.  The idea is to try to mirror the accounts and balances in proportion to the mainnet.\n\nIf you want full details on setting up a testnet using Tinman, head over to that github:\n\nhttps://github.com/steemit/tinman\n\nOtherwise, let’s do the complete Quick Start:\n\nSections\n\n\n  Minimum Requirements\n  Installing Tinman\n  Building steemd\n  Snapshot\n  Configure Tinman\n  Actions\n  Configure Bootstrap Node\n  Bootstrap Node\n  Configure Seed Node\n  Seed Node\n  Gatling (Optional)\n  Troubleshooting\n\n\nMinimum Requirements\n\nThis tutorial assumes Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS 2GB RAM and 200GB SSD/HDD.\n\nRunning a testnet can be done on minimal hardware, but in order to build a snapshot of accounts, you should already be running your own local Steem node because getting the snapshot is time consuming and if this process is interrupted, you’ll have to start over.\n\nNot only are we going to use tinman to build the snapshot, we also need to compile steemd and configure it to run our testnet.\n\nInstalling Tinman\n\nFirst, we need python (for tinman) and some other libraries:\n\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nsudo apt-get install virtualenv python3 libyajl-dev git pv\nvirtualenv -p $(which python3) ~/ve/tinman\nsource ~/ve/tinman/bin/activate\nmkdir -p ~/src\ncd ~/src\ngit clone --branch master https://github.com/steemit/tinman.git\ncd tinman\npip install pipenv\npipenv install\npip install .\n\n\nBuilding steemd\n\nNext, let’s build steemd.  Note, we are using the develop branch but you can use whatever branch you want.  To see a list of branches that are currently being worked on, refer to: https://github.com/steemit/steem/branches/active\n\nsudo apt-get install autoconf automake autotools-dev bsdmainutils \\\n  build-essential cmake doxygen gdb libboost-all-dev libreadline-dev \\\n  libssl-dev libtool liblz4-tool ncurses-dev pkg-config python3-dev \\\n  python3-pip nginx fcgiwrap awscli gdb libgflags-dev libsnappy-dev zlib1g-dev \\\n  libbz2-dev liblz4-dev libzstd-dev\ncd ~/src\ngit clone --branch develop https://github.com/steemit/steem.git\ncd steem\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\nmkdir -p build\ncd build\nSTEEM_NAME=steem-tn\ncmake \\\n  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=\"~/opt/$STEEM_NAME\" \\\n  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \\\n  -DBUILD_STEEM_TESTNET=ON \\\n  -DLOW_MEMORY_NODE=OFF \\\n  -DCLEAR_VOTES=ON \\\n  -DSKIP_BY_TX_ID=ON \\\n  -DSTEEM_LINT_LEVEL=OFF \\\n  -DENABLE_MIRA=ON \\\n  ..\nmkdir -p ~/opt/$STEEM_NAME\nmake -j$(nproc) install\n\n\nA note on steemd branches:  Selecting a branch depends on why you’re running a testnet.  If you are doing blockchain development, you’re likely going to select your own branch where you’ve done some work that needs to be verified.  If you’re a witness, you’re likely going to select develop or master to check stability.  If you’re an application developer, you should probably select the stable branch because you want to test your app more than test the blockchain.  Application developers might also select develop to try out blockchain features that have not been released yet.\n\nSnapshot\n\nThe snapshot is a copy of all accounts on the blockchain plus some other properties.  Having a full snapshot allows tinman to create a more realistic testnet.  Here’s how we generate a snapshot:\n\ncd ~/src/tinman\nsource ~/ve/tinman/bin/activate\ntinman snapshot -s http://mainnet-steem-node:8090 | pv -l &gt; snapshot.json\n\n\nIn the above example, we assume that http://mainnet-steem-node:8090 is our Steem node on our local network.  If you use a public node to build the snapshot.json file instead (not recommended), just remember that this process could take quite a while and can be interrupted or rate-limited.  You should consider running your own node.\n\nAs of September 2019, assuming the Steem mainnet node is local, this process takes approximately 15 minutes to produce a 3 GB output file.\n\nConfigure Tinman\n\nWe can take all of the defaults in txgen.conf.example, assuming you named your snapshot snapshot.json.\n\ncd ~/src/tinman\ncp txgen.conf.example txgen.conf\n\n\nWe can optionally adjust total_port_balance to adjust the supply on the testnet.  But keep in mind, there is a blockchain limit defined by STEEM_INIT_SUPPLY.\n\nActions\n\nNow that we have our snapshot.json file, we can generate the actions that will build our testnet.\n\ncd ~/src/tinman\nsource ~/ve/tinman/bin/activate\ntinman txgen -c txgen.conf -o bootstrap-init.actions\n\n\nBuilding the actions is pure data-processing that doesn’t communicate with the outside world.  It only processes the JSON snapshot and config file into more JSON.  As of September 2019, this process takes approximately 90 minutes to produce a 2 GB output file.\n\nConfigure Bootstrap Node\n\nSTEEM_NAME=steem-tn\nBOOTSTRAP=~/data/bootstrap\nSTEEMD=~/opt/$STEEM_NAME/bin/steemd\n$STEEMD --data-dir=$BOOTSTRAP\n\n\nAt the startup banner, press ^C (Ctrl+C) to exit steemd.  As a side effect, a default data-dir is created.  Now we can purge the empty blockchain and create config.ini as follows:\n\nrm -Rf $BOOTSTRAP/blockchain\nnano $BOOTSTRAP/config.ini\n\n\nThen make the following changes to the generated config.ini:\n\n\n  Enable plugins chain debug_node p2p webserver block_api chain_api database_api debug_node_api network_broadcast_api\n  Pick a random port for p2p, say 12541\n  Edit shared-file-size down, say 12G\n  Pick a random port for webserver-http-endpoint and set webserver-ws-endpoint to the next-highest port.\n\n\nTo summarize, the changed values are:\n\nplugin = chain debug_node p2p webserver block_api chain_api database_api debug_node_api network_broadcast_api\nshared-file-size = 12G\np2p-endpoint = 0.0.0.0:12541\nwebserver-http-endpoint = 0.0.0.0:18751\nwebserver-ws-endpoint = 0.0.0.0:18752\n\n\nSave config.ini and start steemd:\n\n$STEEMD --data-dir=$BOOTSTRAP\n\n\nBootstrap Node\n\nNote, the secret can be any string.  In this tutorial, we are using new-steem-rocks as the secret.  Keep in mind that any person with knowledge of the secret will be able to transact using any account on your testnet.\n\nSTEEM_NAME=steem-tn\nGET_DEV_KEY=~/opt/$STEEM_NAME/bin/get_dev_key\nSIGN_TRANSACTION=~/opt/$STEEM_NAME/bin/sign_transaction\n\ncd ~/src/tinman\nsource ~/ve/tinman/bin/activate\n\n( \\\n  echo '[\"set_secret\", {\"secret\":\"new-steem-rocks\"}]' ; \\\n  cat bootstrap-init.actions \\\n) | \\\ntinman keysub --get-dev-key $GET_DEV_KEY | \\\ntinman submit -t http://127.0.0.1:18751 \\\n    --signer $SIGN_TRANSACTION \\\n    -f die \\\n    --timeout 600\n\n\nThe above command will send bootstrap-init.actions to the bootstrap node using “fastgen” (as rapidly as possible).  Fastgen functionality is provided by debug_node_api.  Without fastgen, this process would take 3 seconds per 40 action (by default).\n\nConfigure Seed Node\n\nOnce the bootstrap is complete and we no longer need fastgen to import actions, we can start a new testnet node without debug_node_api.  For simplicity, this new seed node will also run our initial witnesses for block signing.\n\nWe need to keep the Bootstrap Node running, so do the following in a new shell session:\n\nSTEEM_NAME=steem-tn\nSEED=~/data/seed\nSTEEMD=~/opt/$STEEM_NAME/bin/steemd\nGET_DEV_KEY=~/opt/$STEEM_NAME/bin/get_dev_key\n$STEEMD --data-dir=$SEED\n\n\nAgain, at the startup banner, press ^C (Ctrl+C) to exit steemd.\n\nrm -Rf $SEED/blockchain\nnano $SEED/config.ini\n\n\nThen make the following changes to the generated config.ini:\n\n\n  Enable plugins chain p2p webserver witness database_api network_broadcast_api block_api\n  Pick the Bootstrap ip/port for p2p-seed-node 127.0.0.1:12541\n  Pick a new port for p2p, say 2541\n  Edit shared-file-size down, say 24G\n  Pick a new random port for webserver-http-endpoint and set webserver-ws-endpoint to the next-highest port.\n  Enable stale block production with enable-stale-production = true\n  Set required participation with required-participation = 0\n  Add whitelist for RC with rc-account-whitelist = porter tnman\n  TODO research: rc-skip-reject-not-enough-rc = true\n\n\nNow we need to add the names of all of the witnesses:\n\nfor N in $(seq 0 21)\ndo\necho \"witness = \\\"init-$N\\\"\" &gt;&gt; $SEED/config.ini\ndone\n\n\nAdd their private keys as well, note we are assuming the secret is new-steem-rocks for this tutorial:\n\nfor K in $($GET_DEV_KEY new-steem-rocks block-init-0:21 | cut -d '\"' -f 4)\ndo\necho \"private-key = $K\" &gt;&gt; $SEED/config.ini\ndone\n\n\nTo summarize, the changed and new values are:\n\nplugin = chain p2p webserver witness database_api network_broadcast_api block_api\nshared-file-size = 24G\np2p-seed-node = 127.0.0.1:12541\np2p-endpoint = 0.0.0.0:2541\nwebserver-http-endpoint = 0.0.0.0:8751\nwebserver-ws-endpoint = 0.0.0.0:8752\nenable-stale-production = true\nrequired-participation = 0\nrc-account-whitelist = porter tnman\nrc-skip-reject-not-enough-rc = true\nwitness = \"init-0\"\nwitness = \"init-1\"\nwitness = \"init-2\"\nwitness = \"init-3\"\nwitness = \"init-4\"\nwitness = \"init-5\"\nwitness = \"init-6\"\nwitness = \"init-7\"\nwitness = \"init-8\"\nwitness = \"init-9\"\nwitness = \"init-10\"\nwitness = \"init-11\"\nwitness = \"init-12\"\nwitness = \"init-13\"\nwitness = \"init-14\"\nwitness = \"init-15\"\nwitness = \"init-16\"\nwitness = \"init-17\"\nwitness = \"init-18\"\nwitness = \"init-19\"\nwitness = \"init-20\"\nwitness = \"init-21\"\nprivate-key = 5JDt8ydrkcr1DpgKychydc3iHYLAkHAw4gvKNTuqAFhd71tj6ZQ\nprivate-key = 5KcCrHxKAMJ9kzLzkELSxJBuC2D7sTeab4Ne9SksLkacBFic5pj\nprivate-key = 5J6RRNLd8LcL2ZuHGzKFukc4EqhvgHWRkMQHjnQCz528ubL27Y8\nprivate-key = 5HqwZyAenu16JV4GLHDdKAXGprdGpAqLGZ6ryK1s3rmkUYxRMSv\nprivate-key = 5Kg6doMKYJyPqgc6Xq6qXmGdLBfZATEGoTLWpWuAGvGHUtABWH2\nprivate-key = 5Hw7B3vVSg3mMiRBXie8AUmTphJTThA6trDjQ4M36vU77Xodz8g\nprivate-key = 5KUZUiLHqHj9Yd37EEqrj4QHmuJqi4jc1Vhf8KhH7uxP2BwJFgL\nprivate-key = 5Je57g7PartUHQi9k7pZMbZmBe4M1DvJPz6seC2hqcWLjauh9Jh\nprivate-key = 5J9vVvc3kWBwuqwmN8veAmxXbGwndjVZCRuWZWnLdo19Xa5eLZQ\nprivate-key = 5KGyprgawwQXcUDnEukfRdc6QZpwdp8Y8DNswPBd9kNApHuFWbC\nprivate-key = 5J6Jw9cn1ikkstG2NTMt116Ugg7RnsQd4DziiUsAgXVoRqdkGKD\nprivate-key = 5Jt3EZnPoeWvG1Not9tNZ32MornR7Np6v2RAv1c4hwHbgJ1bQPr\nprivate-key = 5KBCLqV2RPwoaUFhFjVwz4Jfq9WzMVVFDxvaeW7ZC6v1PKVZdRU\nprivate-key = 5KaqFR7dbkhFAs5qZ63wjiXZSDviaRkDoE216v889hQoxwwHUsB\nprivate-key = 5JQdnLjjdVMBdNwBgHHEKsUtXirXGdUfJZhVqUBsxCs3Ubn7dcq\nprivate-key = 5K5puF2p8M5svXRGuJqCjwSk1Z41MZ5GtqCktSSX5vhFSWffy3r\nprivate-key = 5Jno5L7jYMxQVehuGy2kAM9rtCdkRyrk97eokMzLro1Rm8CUDUx\nprivate-key = 5KPEWXQnipNHaKaWjjKQ3K3yF5e22eFhu9ozALPhtGaBAfUxckp\nprivate-key = 5JMcAJkWv9Nvy5Pt9vBZmzTymHxrmKgYXB6ekSF9sBgMHyYE2TC\nprivate-key = 5JksFmSJLrFyq3YzdvRWcWzbqKQv4vrFaNEg8ix2zwCmR9JeTW3\nprivate-key = 5JrMAjLaM48dwBco5khuB6FuGasaSxWenwbpqEBL6u4bqTtBgYY\n\n\nSave config.ini and start steemd:\n\n$STEEMD --data-dir=$SEED\n\n\nAt this point, our Seed Node will sync blocks from the Bootstrap Node.\n\nSeed Node\n\nOnce the Seed Node has caught up to the Bootstrap Node, it’s safe to shut down the Bootstrap Node.

Make sure your Seed Node is fully sync’d before running gatling.  Also make sure you use the same secret.\n\nSTEEM_NAME=steem-tn\nGET_DEV_KEY=~/opt/$STEEM_NAME/bin/get_dev_key\nSIGN_TRANSACTION=~/opt/$STEEM_NAME/bin/sign_transaction\n\ncd ~/src/tinman\nsource ~/ve/tinman/bin/activate\n\ncp gatling.conf.example gatling.conf\n\n( \\\n  echo '[\"set_secret\", {\"secret\":\"new-steem-rocks\"}]' ; \\\n  tinman gatling -c gatling.conf -f 0 -t 0 -o - | tinman prefixsub \\\n) | \\\ntinman keysub --get-dev-key $GET_DEV_KEY | \\\ntinman submit --realtime -t http://127.0.0.1:8751 \\\n    --signer $SIGN_TRANSACTION \\\n    --timeout 600 \\\n    --fail /dev/null\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nProblem: Got an error while trying to compile steemd:\n\nc++: internal compiler error: Killed (program cc1plus)\n\n-or-\n\nvirtual memory exhausted: Cannot allocate memory\n\nSolution: Add more memory or enable swap.\n\nTo enable swap (do not enable swap on a VPS like Digital Ocean):\n\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/var/swap.img bs=1024k count=4000\nsudo chmod 600 /var/swap.img\nsudo mkswap /var/swap.img\nsudo swapon /var/swap.img\n\n\n\n\nProblem: Got an error while trying to create bootstrap-init.actions:\n\nijson.common.IncompleteJSONError: b'parse error: premature EOF\n\nSolution: Re-run tinman snapshot in the Snapshot section.

  							"content": "The overarching goal is to stop using condenser_api.broadcast_transaction_synchronous but we still want the benefits.\n\n\n  Why Client-side Computation?\n  Why After Broadcast?\n  Why In General?\n  Client-side Computation\n  After Broadcast\n  Polling\n\n\nWhy Client-side Computation?\n\nThe primary reason to compute the trx_id before broadcast is to track the transaction when quality of service is impacted. If the trx_id is known before condenser_api.broadcast_transaction, but the response times out, we can still track the transaction.\n\nWhy After Broadcast?\n\nAssuming quality of service has not been impacted, solely relying on the condenser_api.broadcast_transaction response should not be a problem.\n\nWhy In General?\n\nWhichever method we use above to get trx_id, we can track it if anything goes wrong while we wait for it to be included in a block. Then, even after it’s included, we can still track a transaction while we wait for 2/3rds of the witnesses to verify (thus irreversable). We can poll transaction_status_api until we’re satisfied that the trx_id has been included.\nClient-side Computation\n\nFirst, create a transaction, for example:\n\n{\n   \"ref_block_num\":20,\n   \"ref_block_prefix\":2890012981,\n   \"expiration\":\"2018-10-15T19:52:09\",\n   \"operations\":[\n      {\n         \"type\":\"transfer_to_vesting_operation\",\n         \"value\":{\n            \"from\":\"alice\",\n            \"to\":\"bob\",\n            \"amount\":{\"amount\":\"8204\", \"precision\":3, \"nai\":\"@@000000021\"}\n         }\n      }\n   ],\n   \"extensions\":[]\n}\n\n\nFrom this, we create a serialization, call it hex:\n\n1400351942ace9efc45b010305616c69636503626f620c2000000000000003535445454d00000\n\n\nNext, we convert hex to binary, call it bytes and digest bytes, with sha256, call it digest:\n\neba610257ad6c60d89f84ce54d3e10b52c18d4cce5547867e2450aeac80d9530\n\n\nLast, we truncate digest to 20 bytes / 40 hex digits:\n\neba610257ad6c60d89f84ce54d3e10b52c18d4cc\n\n\nThis is the computed trx_id.\n\nAfter Broadcast\n\nIf your client does not support client-side id computation, you can still get the trx_id from the result of condenser_api.broadcast_transaction.\n\nThe combination of condenser_api.broadcast_transaction and transaction_status_api.find_transaction, described below, allows us to avoid using condenser_api.broadcast_transaction_synchronous, which is being deprecated.\n\nPolling\n\nNow that we have trx_id, we can poll transaction_status_api.find_transaction, for example:\n\ncurl -s --data '{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\", \"method\":\"transaction_status_api.find_transaction\", \"params\":{\"transaction_id\":\"eba610257ad6c60d89f84ce54d3e10b52c18d4cc\"}, \"id\":1}' https://api.steemit.com\n\n\nWhich returns:\n\n{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"result\":{\"status\":\"unknown\"},\"id\":1}\n\n\nWe can provide the expiration:\n\ncurl -s --data '{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\", \"method\":\"transaction_status_api.find_transaction\", \"params\":{\"transaction_id\":\"eba610257ad6c60d89f84ce54d3e10b52c18d4cc\",\"expiration\":\"2018-10-15T19:52:09\"}, \"id\":1}' https://api.steemit.com\n\n\nWhich returns:\n\n{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"result\":{\"status\":\"too_old\"},\"id\":1}\n\n\nPossible status results are:\n\n\n  \n    \n      Status\n      Meaning\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      unknown\n      Expiration time in future, transaction not included in block or mempool\n    \n    \n      within_mempool\n      Transaction in mempool\n    \n    \n      within_reversible_block\n      Transaction has been included in block, block not irreversible (result will also contain block_num)\n    \n    \n      within_irreversible_block\n      Transaction has been included in block, block is irreversible (result will also contain block_num)\n    \n    \n      expired_reversible\n      Transaction has expired, transaction is not irreversible (transaction could be in a fork)\n    \n    \n      expired_irreversible\n      Transaction has expired, transaction is irreversible (transaction cannot be in a fork)\n    \n    \n      too_old\n      Transaction is too old, I don’t know about it\n    \n  \n\n\nSee: transaction_status_api"

  							"content": "Intro\n\nHive is a “consensus interpretation” layer for the Steem blockchain, maintaining the state of social features such as post feeds, follows, and communities. Written in Python, it synchronizes an SQL database with chain state, providing developers with a more flexible/extensible alternative to the raw steemd API. This means that you can bypass steemd and access data in a more traditional way, for example, with SQL. But you can’t use SQL on steemd. So Hivemind solves that problem. Hive does not support any queries to do with wallets, orders, escrow, keys, recovery, or account history.\n\nA good source of additional information on hive and how to use it can be found in this Steemit article by @inertia.\n\nSupported API functionality:\n\nCore API set available in Hive:\n\n\n  condenser_api.get_follow_count\n  condenser_api.get_followers\n  condenser_api.get_following\n  condenser_api.get_discussions_by_trending\n  condenser_api.get_discussions_by_hot\n  condenser_api.get_discussions_by_promoted\n  condenser_api.get_discussions_by_created\n  condenser_api.get_discussions_by_blog\n  condenser_api.get_discussions_by_feed\n  condenser_api.get_discussions_by_comments\n  condenser_api.get_discussions_by_last_update\n  condenser_api.get_content\n  condenser_api.get_state\n\n\nAdditional functions available within hive-steem library\n\nThe majority of these functions are reliant on steemd so any changes to steemd would affect these function calls. The only two functions not directly reliant on steemd are stream_blocks and get_steem_per_mvest.\n\n\n  get_accounts\n  get_all_account_names\n  get_content_batch\n  get_block\n  stream_blocks\n  _gdgp (get dynamic global properties)\n  head_time\n  head_block\n  last_irreversible\n  gdgp_extended\n  get_steem_per_mvest\n  get_feed_price\n  get_steem_price\n  get_blocks_range\n\n\nDetailed information on the hive-steem library can be found in the Hivemind repo.\n\nHivemind dependencies and setup\n\nHivemind is available as a pre-built docker image which can be downloaded directly from Dockerhub at https://hub.docker.com/r/steemit/hivemind/.\n\nIf you would prefer to install Hivemind yourself you can do so following the basic instructions below.\n\nThis setup can be performed on an Ubuntu server.\n\nThere are two dependencies for setting up the dev environment on ubuntu for running hivemind:\n\n\n  Python\n\n\n$ sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip\n\n\n\n  Postgres\n\n\n$ sudo apt-get install postgresql\n\n\nMore detailed documentation on the setup of Hivemind can be found at the Hivemind github repository.\n\nOnce the dependencies have been installed the database can be created and the environment variables set.\n\n$ createdb hive\n$ export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/hive\n\n\nBy default Hivemind will connect to the mainnet https://api.steemit.com but if required you can change this to connect to a testnet. To do this set the environment variable as described below.\n\n$ export STEEMD_URL=https://testnet.steem.vc\n\n\nNow that the basic setup is done you are able to sync the database.\n\n$ hive sync\n\n\nYou can also check the status of your synced database.\n\n$ hive status\n\n\nOnce the synchronization is complete you can start the Hivemind server which will allow you to start performing queries on your local database.\n\n$ hive server\n\n\nBy default the server is available on http://0.0.0.0:8080, this can also be changed by adding an environment variable.\n\n$ export HTTP_SERVER_PORT=8090"

  							"content": "Image: Skitterphoto, CC0\n\nRepository\nhttps://github.com/holgern/beem\n\nThis post is a contribution to the Multisignature Transaction Guide request by @timcliff.\n\n\nEdit: In the meantime, beem/beempy was adjusted to support the full procedure out-of-the-box. For a ready-to-use CLI interface for multi-sig coming with beem, please refer to:\nMultisignature Transaction Guide for beempy\n\n\n\nWhat Will I Learn?\n\n\n  You will learn how to set-up a multi-signature authority for Steem accounts\n  You will learn how to prepare a transaction to be signed by multiple keys\n  You will learn how to sign transactions with multiple keys and broadcast it to the chain\n\n\nRequirements\n\nThe user must have a basic understanding of the Steem key and account authority system as well as the corresponding weights and thresholds. The user should be familiar with Python and using Python scripts on the command line. Some knowledge about beem is required to go beyond the provided example.\n\nDifficulty\nAdvanced\n\n\n\nSetting up a multi-signature authority Steem account\n\nThe @steemit account is an example of an account that has multiple key authorities for each role:\n\nBlockchain transactions sent in the name of the @steemit account can be signed by any of the two keys per role (owner/active/posting). While this account has multiple authorities, it is not a multi-signature account since the threshold parameter on each role is set to 1 - this means that a signature with weight 1 is sufficient to authorize the transaction.\nAn account becomes a multi-signature account as soon as the weight of a single signature is not sufficient to reach the threshold. Here is an example of a multi-sig account where this condition is fulfilled:\n\n\n\nThis account has an active threshold of 40 while each of the authorized keys can provide a weight of at most 25 or 10. This means that transactions requiring the active authority need to be signed by multiple of the authorized keys.\n\n\n\nHow to set an account into this state with beem\n\nIn order to set owner, active or posting authorities, weights and thresholds, the Account_update function from beembase.operations is needed. The operation can be prepared in the following way:\n\nfrom beem.account import Account\nfrom beembase import operations\nacc = Account(\"accountname\")\nop = operations.Account_update(**{\n    \"account\": acc[\"name\"],\n    'active': acc[\"active\"],\n    'posting': acc[\"posting\"],\n    'memo_key': acc['memo_key'],\n    \"json_metadata\": acc['json_metadata'],\n    \"prefix\": acc.steem.prefix})\n\n\nacc[\"posting\"] and acc[\"active\"] are dictionaries in the style of:\nauthority = {\n  'account_auths': [], \n  'key_auths': [\n    ['STMKEY1...', 25], \n    ['STMKEY2...', 10]],\n  'address_auths': [], \n  'weight_threshold': 100, \n  'prefix': acc.steem.prefix}\n\n\n(adjust the keys, the weights and the threshold accordingly). Make sure that the sum of the individual weights reaches or exceeds the threshold, otherwise no combination of multiple signatures will be able to work with the active authority.\n\nThis operation can then be submitted with a TransactionBuilder instance:\n\nfrom beem.transactionbuilder import TransactionBuilder\ntb = TransactionBuilder(steem_instance=acc.steem)\ntb.appendOps([op])\ntb.appendWif(owner_wif)\ntb.sign()\ntx = tb.broadcast()\nprint(tx)\n\nSince this is modifying the active authority of the account, this operation has to be signed with the owner key. The same concept also applies to the posting authorities, but changing those only required the corresponding active key.\n\nThe result is what is shown in the screenshot above and was carried out with the @test.auth account.\n\nA basic, but ready-to-use script to set arbitrary active and posting authorities is provided here:\nhttps://gist.github.com/crokkon/17e5be82d9ef073bcee80a461a11dea9#file-set_authorities-py\n\nThis script can be used like this:\npython set_authorities.py \\\n  --account test.auth \\\n  --role active \\\n  --threshold 40 \\\n  --key-weight STM7JNWU2b2DBMp9WZRGHKqE7hQA9MKn2URLBCMfU95p29vzAQn8F 25 \\\n  --key-weight STM5iLWNocQk8UDUVpuGytJkmLiEuK9XYvyMH3yYRdXhW6qGqbWA4 25 \\\n  --key-weight STM6qpVTxhWBuKUFgUHgymuQrtRwZ16bWmyZVf7ba4QzoYypEXS5X 10 \\\n  --key-weight STM8Hp2EPPgddvQRGYUFomX5v8ixh1LeoFKk3FCTxMwkSvzieGrDg 10 \\\n  --key-weight STM75MGQ6WLhSqNoUYsm6oXeGp3R5KPpaKgtoLUHTtcS5vhrWmrtJ 10 \\\n  --key-weight STM6Ukq4htXhnkKDdR45XgCLJY8a8eJV9ndUmLBT32ktPzYdvqPJy 10 \\\n  --key-weight STM6AFxvirq6P1XTeiYEwfTCMXivJsg9wmZDBrWxG5fQkvgzRZwHX 10\n\nSupported --role parameters are active and posting. The --key-weight parameter takes a space-separated pair of a pubkey and a weight. There is also an --account-weight parameter taking an account name plus weight. Note that there is an upper limit of 40 authorities (keys and accounts combined) per role.\n\nThis is the resulting transaction from this script:\n\n\nEdit: the same state can be achieved via multiplebeempy commands as suggested by @tcpolymath in the comments, e.g.:\n$ beempy allow -a \"test.auth\" --permission active --weight 25 --threshold 40 STM7JNWU2b2DBMp9WZRGHKqE7hQA9MKn2URLBCMfU95p29vzAQn8F\n\n\n\n\nHow to prepare a transaction to be signed by multiple keys?\n\nTransaction that are sent to the blockchain have the following format:\n{\"expiration\": \"2019-01-04T21:05:55\", \"ref_block_num\": 6032, \"ref_block_prefix\": 1020164711, \"operations\": [[\"transfer\", {\"from\": \"test.auth\", \"to\": \"test.auth\", \"amount\": \"0.001 STEEM\", \"memo\": \"\"}]], \"extensions\": [], \"signatures\": []}\n\nexpiration defines how long the transaction is going to be valid. Typical numbers are 1 minute (beem default), the maximum allowed by the blockchain is 1 hour. Since not all signatures are added instantly, choosing a longer period is reasonable in this case. ref_block_num and ref_block_prefix are values that the blockchain provides on request. The operations parameter contains the desired user operation (in this case transferring 0.001 STEEM to self). extensions is typically empty. signatures is a list of strings that is filled by signing this operation. In case of a “normal” transaction, the final signature filed would contain a lengthy string of characters and numbers. Multiple signatures can be achieved by signing the same operation with multiple keys independently, and list all resulting signatures in the signatures field.\n\nIn order to create such a base transaction, we can again use the TransactionBuilder class:\nop = operations.Transfer(**{\n    'from': args.account,\n    'to': args.to,\n    'amount': Amount(args.amount, args.asset),\n    'memo': args.memo\n})\nstm = Steem(expiration=3600)\ntb = TransactionBuilder(steem_instance=stm)\ntb.appendOps([op])\nprint(\"'%s'\" % (json.dumps(tb.json())))\n\n(note the override of the expiration period to 1h = 3600s). The resulting output was the transaction string shown above.\n\nA basic, but ready-to-use script to create an arbitrary transfer transaction is provided here:\nhttps://gist.github.com/crokkon/17e5be82d9ef073bcee80a461a11dea9#file-get_transaction-py\n\nThis script can be used like this:\npython get_transaction.py \\\n  --account test.auth \\\n\t--to test.auth \\\n\t--amount 0.001 \\\n\t--asset STEEM\n\nan optional --memo parameter allows you to set a transfer memo as well.\n\nEdit: also this stage can be done directly via beempy:\n$ beempy -e 3600 --no-broadcast --unsigned transfer --account \"test.auth\" \"test.auth\" 0.001 STEEM\n\n\n\n\nHow to sign this transaction now with multiple keys and broadcast it to the chain?\n\nSigning this transaction means appending an entry to the signatures list of the transaction. This signature can be obtained by loading the above transaction with the TransactionBuilder class, append a private key and use the sign() method. Each time this step is done, another signature is appended to the list:\ntb = TransactionBuilder(tx=op)\ntb.appendWif(wif)\ntb.sign(reconstruct_tx=False)\n\nImportant here is that the transaction has to be passed to the TransactionBuilder constructor and the sign method has to be instructed not to reconstruct the transaction but take it as it is. If this parameter is not set, the class will strip off existing signatures and update expiration, ref_block_num and ref_block_prefix to the current values.\n\nOnce the required number of signatures is appended to meet or exceed the threshold, the transaction can be broadcasted:\ntx = tb.broadcast()\n\n\nA basic, but ready-to-use script to sign transaction with multiple keys and broadcast it to the chain is provided here:\nhttps://gist.github.com/crokkon/17e5be82d9ef073bcee80a461a11dea9#file-sign_and_broadcast-py\n\nThis script can be used like shown below. The same script is fed multiple times with the output of the previous step each. This ensures, that the same transaction can be signed successively by independent people and broadcasted as soon as the weight threshold is reached:\n# first signature: run with the trx created above:\n$ python sign_and_broadcast.py --append-sig --trx '{\"expiration\": \"2019-01-04T22:13:41\", \"ref_block_num\": 7386, \"ref_block_prefix\": 3706177428, \"operations\": [[\"transfer\", {\"from\": \"test.auth\", \"to\": \"test.auth\", \"amount\": \"0.001 STEEM\", \"memo\": \"\"}]], \"extensions\": [], \"signatures\": []}'\nEnter private key:\n'{\"expiration\": \"2019-01-04T22:13:41\", \"ref_block_num\": 7386, \"ref_block_prefix\": 3706177428, \"operations\": [[\"transfer\", {\"from\": \"test.auth\", \"to\": \"test.auth\", \"amount\": \"0.001 STEEM\", \"memo\": \"\"}]], \"extensions\": [], \"signatures\": [\"1f65df7e3fb5f3ad49c433054127d71918c10865d67367efa380edee2e9943540d1e6f97317a1cdfe547f49d89048a44bd2f9a9a7278e51b9fef98dfddaee576da\"]}'\n\n# second signature - run the same script with the output of step 1 - note the two sigs in the output:\n$ python sign_and_broadcast.py --append-sig --trx '{\"expiration\": \"2019-01-04T22:13:41\", \"ref_block_num\": 7386, \"ref_block_prefix\": 3706177428, \"operations\": [[\"transfer\", {\"from\": \"test.auth\", \"to\": \"test.auth\", \"amount\": \"0.001 STEEM\", \"memo\": \"\"}]], \"extensions\": [], \"signatures\": [\"1f65df7e3fb5f3ad49c433054127d71918c10865d67367efa380edee2e9943540d1e6f97317a1cdfe547f49d89048a44bd2f9a9a7278e51b9fef98dfddaee576da\"]}'\nEnter private key:\n'{\"expiration\": \"2019-01-04T22:13:41\", \"ref_block_num\": 7386, \"ref_block_prefix\": 3706177428, \"operations\": [[\"transfer\", {\"from\": \"test.auth\", \"to\": \"test.auth\", \"amount\": \"0.001 STEEM\", \"memo\": \"\"}]], \"extensions\": [], \"signatures\": [\"1f65df7e3fb5f3ad49c433054127d71918c10865d67367efa380edee2e9943540d1e6f97317a1cdfe547f49d89048a44bd2f9a9a7278e51b9fef98dfddaee576da\", \"205d6e432fa276f0ef7c5da90703811d01b1358348ec5c1de5bd1504b7990d4f42121542d5d555a8fbb974db316d84714f7da2c43a5160bc00548fda6b15c33687\"]}'\n\n# third signature: run the same script with the output of step 2, add the --broadcast parameter and note the three sigs in the output:\n$ python sign_and_broadcast.py --append-sig --trx '{\"expiration\": \"2019-01-04T22:13:41\", \"ref_block_num\": 7386, \"ref_block_prefix\": 3706177428, \"operations\": [[\"transfer\", {\"from\": \"test.auth\", \"to\": \"test.auth\", \"amount\": \"0.001 STEEM\", \"memo\": \"\"}]], \"extensions\": [], \"signatures\": [\"1f65df7e3fb5f3ad49c433054127d71918c10865d67367efa380edee2e9943540d1e6f97317a1cdfe547f49d89048a44bd2f9a9a7278e51b9fef98dfddaee576da\", \"205d6e432fa276f0ef7c5da90703811d01b1358348ec5c1de5bd1504b7990d4f42121542d5d555a8fbb974db316d84714f7da2c43a5160bc00548fda6b15c33687\"]}' --broadcast\nEnter private key:\nSUCCESS: broadcasted '{\n  \"expiration\": \"2019-01-04T22:13:41\",\n  \"ref_block_num\": 7386,\n  \"ref_block_prefix\": 3706177428,\n  \"operations\": [\n    [\n      \"transfer\",\n      {\n        \"from\": \"test.auth\",\n        \"to\": \"test.auth\",\n        \"amount\": \"0.001 STEEM\",\n        \"memo\": \"\"\n      }\n    ]\n  ],\n  \"extensions\": [],\n  \"signatures\": [\n    \"1f65df7e3fb5f3ad49c433054127d71918c10865d67367efa380edee2e9943540d1e6f97317a1cdfe547f49d89048a44bd2f9a9a7278e51b9fef98dfddaee576da\",\n    \"205d6e432fa276f0ef7c5da90703811d01b1358348ec5c1de5bd1504b7990d4f42121542d5d555a8fbb974db316d84714f7da2c43a5160bc00548fda6b15c33687\",\n    \"20049d276c86a99d472d4962dc1adbf26a6cf2bdf56a87eae74a19d19394081a9a4b0f89f89dd1c632dcee13b2f688303cbf3f2f2e85ea587c88e9ff9dd66b7c8f\"\n  ]\n}'\n\n\nhere’s the resulting transaction on steemd:\nhttps://steemd.com/tx/5d1124e30b20c47f31517848500636cf7ec2e886\n\n\nAnd an example transferring 0.001 STEEM to my account with 4 signatures as required when using only the keys with weight=10:\nhttps://steemd.com/tx/ae16ba50728536b6a3a10ace03cb82512a51f6b4\n\n\n(this step is currently not yet possible with beempy, but there is work in progress to fully integrate all steps)\n\n\n\nFurther thoughts:\n\n  A big limitation for mass adoption of multi-sig is the fact that the maximum transaction expiration time can only be 1h at most. This can be a at least annoying or even a problem if multiple people that live in different time zones or have a life outside of Steem have to work together to reach the signature threshold.\n  Even with a multi-sig active authority, transfers can still be done with the owner authority (currently requiring only one sig with the example account).\n  However, the exact same concept can be applied to the owner authority as well. This has to be done carefully, since a mistake there could render the account unusable and the funds locked. With access to the recovery partner’s active key, it could still be recovered, though.\n  For the signing and broadcasting part, there is currently no automated check if the required number of signatures to meet or exceed the threshold is reached, but this could be implemented by reconstructing the signers of the existing signatures and checking their weight against the required threshold.\n\n\nProof of Work Done\nAll code shown here is available as a GitHub Gist:\nhttps://gist.github.com/crokkon/17e5be82d9ef073bcee80a461a11dea9\n\n\n\n  See: Steem Multi-Signature Transaction Guide for Beem/Python\n  by\n  @crokkon"

  							"content": "This recipe will take you through the process of streaming blockchain transactions, both from head_block_num and last_irreversible_block_num, and explain the presence/absence of virtual operations in the streamed transactions.\n\nIntro\n\nThere are two points from which Steem blockchain transactions can be streamed to give a “live” view of what’s happening on the blockchain. The first is from the head block which is the most recent block created on the chain (every 3 seconds when a new block is created). The second, is from the last irreversible block which is the newest block that has been confirmed by a sufficient number of block producers so that it can no longer be invalidated. This is not a live view but it is normally not far behind the head block number.\n\nThere is already a javascript tutorial on the devportal describing how to stream blockchain transactions. This recipe will go into further detail on operations on each block and more specifically the virtual operations that are executed with every new block. We will also assume that you have already run through the basic tutorials on the Steem blockchain and will focus more on the specific functions and outputs pertinent to this topic.\n\nSteps\n\n\n  Blocks, transactions and operations\n  Virtual operation streaming\n\n\n1. Blocks, transactions and operations \n\nIn order to stream a block and get the information as will be shown below we use the blockchain api in the dsteem library. The below method has an option parameter mode that defaults to irreversible but can be set to latest which would then return the head block. This means that both types of blocks can be streamed.\n\nstream = client.blockchain.getBlockStream();\n    stream\n        .on('data', function(block) {\n            console.log(block);\n            ...\n            ...\n\n\nBelow is an example of what a block looks like:\n\n{\n  \"block_id\":\"017fa2a9b142cd8d3607b7e7421412402bf97957\",\n  \"extensions\":[],\n  \"previous\":\"017fa2a867978140e7553bbfd65396a5a8136d53\",\n  \"signing_key\":\"STM5gBt5xvdb5vhmXjBqfzQ7vwr4hFF5rjmYmZnSbzdb9eWmk9or5\",\n  \"timestamp\":\"2018-08-17T08:31:48\",\n  \"transaction_ids\": [],\n  \"transaction_merkle_root\":\"4f0d61928ce9595aec6558fb53f1af1b8de06d78\",\n  \"transactions\": [],\n  \"witness\":\"smooth.witness\",\n  \"witness_signature\":\"204e00e747ce75b24fc26b5d18f12992197c61de0bf27c830416761bd25648238239c5eb26a5e392d474e27c601842e2ccf105ffb47f5a5712727412a18f106dbb\"\n}\n\n\nEach block contains transactions:\n\n{\n  \"block_num\": 25141929,\n  \"expiration\": \"2018-08-17T08:41:42\",\n  \"extensions\": [],\n  \"operations\": [],\n  \"ref_block_num\": 41616,\n  \"ref_block_prefix\": 3838737669,\n  \"signatures\": [\"1f261ccf59131dcd10334a40b8b76bd2e80b05eee1c8deaedb…ebb7e4a4d6e22f7823940248f1488978d4ec8ecbd8abbd88e\"],\n  \"transaction_id\": \"a972aef3388908f8a4b4a8d889fb89c83d2b8eb3\",\n  \"transaction_num\": 0\n}\n\n\nAnd each transaction contains operations:\n\n[\n  \"vote\", \n  {\n    \"author\":\"skmedia\",\n    \"permlink\":\"buynearn-new-mlm-plan-launched-4th-june-2018-new-mlm-plan-2018-10inr-4-buynearn-online\",\n    \"voter\":\"nazann\",\n    \"weight\":4700  \n  }\n]\n\n\n2. Virtual operation streaming \n\nVirtual operations (curation rewards, etc) are derived from blockchain activity, but aren’t actually stored as operations themselves. They happen based on consensus from the blockchain based on other user initiated operations. These virtual operations are NOT available on the head block, so a 100% live feed of this information would not be possible. In order then to follow these operations you would have to stream the last_irreversible_block. To get a feed of virtual operations, each of the block transactions needs to be investigated for the type of the operations.\n\nsteem-python provides a very simple method to stream virtual or any other operations directly:\n\nfrom steem import Steem\nfrom steem.blockchain import Blockchain\nimport pprint\ns = Steem()\nb = Blockchain(s)\n\nfor op in b.stream('author_reward'):\n    pprint.pprint(op)\n    # break\n\n\nWith result:\n\n{\n  \"_id\": \"11cb40b9283c8a89ed5d8c348cbc68d76a9d8bd3\",\n  \"author\": \"hopehash\",\n  \"block_num\": 25145619,\n  \"permlink\": \"hopehash-btc-1-057\",\n  \"sbd_payout\": \"0.000 SBD\",\n  \"steem_payout\": \"2.341 STEEM\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2018-08-17T17:11:36.18\",\n  \"trx_id\": \"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\n  \"type\": \"author_reward\",\n  \"vesting_payout\": \"4740.455508 VESTS\"\n}\n\n\nFrom the above example all operations of type “author_reward” will be printed on the console/terminal. You can change the type to which ever operation you want to stream or remove the parameter and stream all operations. The same logic can be followed when using steem-js by isolating the operations of each transaction and looking for the required operation type. Below example is again a modification of the tutorial initially referenced.\n\nstream = client.blockchain.getBlockStream();\n    stream\n        .on('data', function(block) {\n            let x = 0\n            while (x &lt; block.transactions.length) {\n                if (block.transactions[x].operations[0][0] = 'author_reward') {\n                    console.log(block.transactions[x].operations[0]);\n                }\n                x += 1\n            }\n        });\n\n\nThat’s all there is to it."

This instruction will tell the blockchain to append new content to the end of the body of the original comment.\n\nBecause this is a live example, we set broadcast to false so that it only runs if you modify the example and set broadcast to true.\n\nAs stated earlier, you will need to change broadcast to true.  You can also set other values to test this script on other post:\n\n\n  wif - The posting key of the author.\n  author - Name of the account that wrote the post we’re modifying.\n  title - Title of the post.\n  permlink - Leave this if the permlink is derived from the title or set it to the original permlink if you want to modify the title independently from the permlink.\n\n\nTo Run\n\nFirst, set up your workstation using the steps provided in Getting Started.

There are three variables required in the json field of the above operation:\n\n\n  follower - The specific account that will select the author to follow/unfollow.\n  following - The account/author that the account would like to follow.\n  what - The type of follow operation.  This variable can have one of three values: blog to follow an author, ignore to mute, and an empty string to unfollow/unmute.\n\n\nCheck Follow\n\nIn the second example script:\n\nruby check_follow.rb\n\n\nThe API method we’re using here is condenser.get_following.  We pass the name of the account we’re checking.  If the account follows more than 1,000 other accounts, we execute condenser.get_following multiple times and pass the last followed account we know about to get the next 1,000 (passing the latest follows.last each time).\n\nWe also specify blog to tell the API method that we’re looking for followed, not muted (to locate muted accounts, use ignore instead of blog).\n\nTo Run\n\nFirst, set up your workstation using the steps provided in Getting Started.

But there are many other fields to look at.  Let’s break them down by use:\n\nparent_author\n\nIn our script (get_post_details.rb), we use the ruby statement:\n\ncontent.parent_author.empty?\n\n\nWith the above idiom, your application can determine if the content is a root post or reply.  If it’s empty, then you’re working with a root post, otherwise, it’s a reply.\n\nOnce you know you’re dealing with a reply, other fields can be useful for additional details.  For instance, root_author, root_permlink, and root_title can be used to figure out what the original post details are, even if the reply is deeply nested.\n\nlast_update and created\n\nIn our script, we use the ruby statement:\n\ncontent.last_update == content.created\n\n\nWith the above idiom, your application can determine if the content has been modified since it was originally posted.  If they are the same, then there has been no modification.\n\ncashout_time\n\nIn our script, we use the ruby statement:\n\n(cashout = Time.parse(content.cashout_time + 'Z') - Time.now.utc) &gt; 0\n\n\nWith the above idiom, you can use cashout_time to determine if the content has reached payout.  If cashout_time is in the future, the content has not been paid yet.  You can determine the possible future payout by inspecting pending_payout_value.\n\nYou will note that we must parse the string found in content.cashout_time by appending Z (Zulu Time, aka UTC) in order for Time.parse to get the right timezone.\n\nEven before payout, you can determine what the max_accepted_payout is.  Most often, this is set to one of two values by the author:\n\n\n  1000000.000 SBD - Accepted Payout\n  0.000 SBD - Declined Payout\n\n\nIn addition to max_accepted_payout, the author may specify how much of the author reward should be in STEEM Power or liquid rewards.  The most common settings are:\n\n\n  10000 - Maximum Liquid Reward\n  0 - STEEM Power Only\n\n\nOnce the payout time has arrived, it’s possible to determine the split between author and curation by inspecting at author_rewards and curator_payout_value.\n\nbeneficiaries\n\nIn our script, we use the ruby statement:\n\ncontent.beneficiaries.any?\n\n\nSome content will have a beneficiaries array.  This is used to determine reward routes any account, up to eight.  Payouts are in STEEM Power and are expressed as a reward percentage of the author reward.\n\nTo display a list of who the beneficiaries are, use the following ruby code, as seen in the example:\n\ncontent.beneficiaries.each do |beneficiary|\n  puts \"\\t\\t#{beneficiary.account}: #{'%.2f %' % (beneficiary.weight / 100.0)}\"\nend\n\n\nNote, if you just want an array of beneficiary account names, this will work in a pinch:\n\naccounts = content.beneficiaries.map do |beneficiary|\n  beneficiary.account\nend\n\n\nactive_votes\n\nIn our script, we use the ruby statements:\n\nvotes = content.active_votes\nupvotes = votes.select { |v| v.percent &gt; 0 }.size\ndownvotes = votes.select { |v| v.percent &lt; 0 }.size\nunvotes = votes.select { |v| v.percent == 0 }.size\ntop_voter = votes.sort_by { |v| v.rshares.to_i }.last.voter\n\n\nThe above idiom splits all vote types and identifies the top voter.  This is because the active_votes field is an array that shows all votes applied to the content, including upvotes, downvotes, and unvotes (where a vote previously cast is revoked).\n\njson_metadata\n\nIn our script, we use the ruby statements:\n\nmetadata = JSON[content.json_metadata || '{}'] rescue {}\ntags = metadata['tags'] || []\napp = metadata['app']\n\n\nAs you can see from the above example, json_metadata starts out as a string of JSON that can be parsed to determine things like tags and app.  Other data may be present, depending on the application that created the content.\n\nNote, we’re using rescue in case the json_metadata string contains invalid JSON because there is no validation performed on this field by the blockchain when content is broadcasted.\n\nTo Run\n\nFirst, set up your workstation using the steps provided in Getting Started.

To get a copy, clone this repository, change directory to devportal/_includes/tutorials-ruby and do a bundle install to install the required local gems.\n\nFrom there, you can see all of the .rb files referenced on this site.\n\ngit clone https://github.com/steemit/devportal.git\ncd devportal/_includes/tutorials-ruby/\nbundle install\n\n\nTypical-Usage\n\nMost methods can be accessed by creating an instance of Radiator::Api.  It is also possible to specify a different node by passing a url option.\n\nRadiator also internally supports failover by specifying the failover_urls option.\n\nTo use the defaults:\n\napi = Radiator::Api.new\n\n\nTo override the url option:\n\napi = Radiator::Api.new(url: 'https://rpc.steemliberator.com')\n\n\nTo override both url and failover_urls options:\n\noptions = {\n  url: 'https://rpc.steemliberator.com',\n  failover_urls: [\n    'https://gtg.steem.house:8090',\n    'https://steemd.minnowsupportproject.org',\n    'https://steemd.privex.io',\n  ]\n}\napi = Radiator::Api.new(options)\n\n\nNext Step\n\nIf you’d like to dive right into the first tutorial, have a look at: Blog Feed"

Error - error output from a unsuccessful call\n    \n  \n  Custom JSON Fields - understanding the result\n  To Run - Running the example.\n\n\nMaking the api call\n\nTo broadcast the operation, we can use a Radiator::Transaction instance:\n\ntx = Radiator::Transaction.new\n\n\ntx.process(true)\n\n\nPassing true to Radiator::Transaction#process will broadcast the operations queued in the operations array of the transaction.\n\nExample api call\n\nIf we want to reblog, we need to form the json properly, for example:\n\ndata = [\n  :reblog, {\n    account: reblogger,\n    author: author,\n    permlink: permlink\n  }\n]\n\ntx.operations &lt;&lt; {\n  type: :custom_json,\n  id: 'follow',\n  required_auths: [],\n  required_posting_auths: [reblogger],\n  json: data.to_json\n}\n\n\nExample api call using script\n\nAnd to do the same with our tutorial script:\n\nruby reblogging_post.rb https://steemit.com/@inertia/kinda-spooky\n\n\nExample Output\n\nFrom the example we get the following output from our script:\n\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"result\": {\n    \"id\": \"0aa41e06b2612315d32cadeb671eb1201f266dd7\",\n    \"block_num\": 24063620,\n    \"trx_num\": 19,\n    \"expired\": false\n  },\n  \"id\": 3\n}\n\n\nThe response we get after broadcasting the transaction gives us the transaction id (0aa41e0...), block number (24063620), and the transaction number of that block (19).\n\nExample Error\n\nIf a post has already been reblogged by the account, we will get back an error:\n\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": -32000,\n    \"message\":

In addition, Radiator will allow you to specify exactly what type of operation you’re interested in.\n\nSections\n\n\n  Streaming Transactions\n  Streaming Operations\n  To Run - Running the example.\n\n\nStreaming Transactions\n\nIn the example script, we can stream transactions with the following arguments:\n\nruby stream_blockchain_transactions.rb head transactions\n\n\nThis will instruct the script to follow transactions at head block_num instead of irreversible.\n\nSee: head_block_number vs. last_irreversible_block_num\n\nThis is done by using the following ruby:\n\nstream.transactions(*args) do |trx|\n  puts JSON.pretty_generate trx\nend\n\n\nThe args variable contains the start (block_num to start from) and mode (head or irreversible).\n\nStreaming Operations\n\nIn the example script, we can also pass the following arguments:\n\nruby stream_blockchain_transactions.rb head ops comment\n\n\nThis will instruct the script to follow the blockchain at head block_num instead of irreversible.  It will stream operations, with the type of comment.\n\nThe script will allow multiple operation types:\n\nruby stream_blockchain_transactions.rb head ops comment vote\n\n\nVirtual operations are also allowed, but make sure to pass irreversible instead of head:\n\nruby stream_blockchain_transactions.rb irreversible ops producer_reward author_reward\n\n\nOr, if you pass no operation types, the script will stream all types:\n\nruby stream_blockchain_transactions.rb head ops\n\n\nThis is done by using the following ruby:\n\nstream.operations(type, *args) do |op|\n  puts op.to_json\nend\n\n\nThe type variable can be nil or the type of ops we’re looking for whereas args contains the start (block_num to start from) and mode (head or irreversible).\n\nTo Run\n\nFirst, set up your workstation using the steps provided in Getting Started.

For example, there could be two authors, alice and bob, and both could have a permlink of firstpost\n  json_metadata - There is no blockchain enforced validation on json_metadata, but the community has adopted a particular structure.  It should contain a JSON object with the following keys:\n    \n      tags - An array of up to 5 strings. Although the blockchain will accept more than 5, the tags plugin only looks at the first five\n      app - A user agent style application identifier. Typically app_name/version, e.g. steemit/0.1\n      format - The format of the body, e.g. markdown\n      In addition to the above keys, application developers are free to add any other keys they want to help manage the content they broadcast.\n    \n  \n\n\nA typical comment operation would look similar to the below:\n\n{\n  \"author\": \"Joe\",\n  \"title\": \"A post by Joe\",\n  \"body\": \"Look at my awesome post\",\n  \"parent_author\": \"\",\n  \"parent_permlink\": \"steem\",\n  \"permlink\": \"a-post-by-joe\",\n  \"json_metadata\": \"{\\\"tags\\\":[\\\"steemit\\\",\\\"example\\\",\\\"tags\\\"]}\"\n}\n\n\nCreate vs. Update\n\nWhen a comment is first broadcast, the permlink must be unique for the author.  Otherwise, it is interpreted as an update operation. Updating will either replace the entire body with the latest operation or patch the body if using diff-match-patch.\n\nFor example, if we have a paragraph that has already been broadcast:\n\n\n  “It’s been quite a lot of fun working with these wonderful folk at Steemit, Inc”\n\n\nAnd we want to change it to:\n\n\n  “It’s been quite a lot of fun working with these wonderful people at Steemit, Inc”\n\n\nWe can broadcast the comment operation with the following body:\n\n- \"@@ -406,12 +406,14 @@\"\n- ful\n- -folk\n- +people\n- at\n\n\nThe blockchain will know that this means we have changed the word ‘folk’ to ‘people’ within that paragraph so when fetching this content, this diff will be applied.\n\nIn addition to body, the title and json_metadata fields will also be replaced by the latest operation.\n\nSee: comment_options, vote, custom_json\n\nIt should also be noted that a vote operation can accompany a comment and comment_options in the same transaction when the author self votes.",

This operation creates an SMT object in the blockchain state.

This is useful for token creators who have put their token in an unlaunchable state.\n\nThis will allow deleting of emission schedules with and changing of precision if there are no emission objects already created.\n\nParameters:\n\n  control_account - The name of the controlling account.\n  symbol - The asset symbol of the created token.\n  smt_creation_fee - The amount to be transfered from @account to null account as elevation fee.
