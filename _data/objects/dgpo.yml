    - name: head_block_number
      purpose: Block height at the head of the blockchain.  This represents the latest block produced by witnesses.
      examples:
        - "`24155032`"
    - name: head_block_id
      purpose: |
        Used to implement TaPoS (Transaction as Proof of Stake).  The first 4 bytes (8 hex digits) of the block ID represents the block number.  E.g., `01709398` in hex is `24155032` in decimal.

    - name: time
      purpose: |
        Point in time (UTC) that the block was included in the chain.
        
        Used to synchronize events like Hard Fork activation.
        
        When attempting to calculate the validity of a transaction we need to lookup a past block and check its block hash and the time it occurred so we can calculate whether the current transaction is valid and at what time it should expire.
        
        For new transactions, expirations originate from this time.

        Maximum block size is decided by the set of active witnesses which change every round.  Each witness posts what they think the maximum size should be as part of their witness properties, the median size is chosen to be the maximum block size for the round.
        
        **Note:** the minimum value for `maximum_block_size` is defined by the protocol to prevent the network from getting stuck by witnesses attempting to set this too low.

        **Removed in 0.20.6, see: [#3029](https://github.com/steemit/steem/issues/3029#issuecomment-428404844)**

        Average block size is updated every block to be: `average_block_size = (99 * average_block_size + new_block_size) / 100`.  This property is used to update the `current_reserve_ratio` to maintain approximately *  50% or less utilization of network capacity.
      examples:
        - "`9309`"
    - name: current_reserve_ratio

        **Removed in 0.20.6, see: [#3029](https://github.com/steemit/steem/issues/3029#issuecomment-428404844)**
        
        Any time `average_block_size <= 50% maximum_block_size` this value grows by 1 until it reaches `STEEM_MAX_RESERVE_RATIO`.  Any time `average_block_size` is greater than 50% it falls by 1%.  Upward adjustments happen once per round, downward adjustments happen every block.
      examples:
        - "`200000000`"

        The maximum bandwidth the blockchain can support is `max_bandwidth = maximum_block_size * STEEM_BANDWIDTH_AVERAGE_WINDOW_SECONDS / STEEM_BLOCK_INTERVAL`; The maximum virtual bandwidth is: `max_bandwidth * current_reserve_ratio`

        The size of the block that is partitioned for actions. Required actions can only be delayed if they take up more than this amount. More can be included, but are not required.
